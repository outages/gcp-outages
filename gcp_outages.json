        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, February 27, 2023, Google Cloud Networking’s production network experienced significant packet loss starting 04:58 US/Pacific for a duration of up to seven minutes. This caused errors and failures in several downstream Google Cloud and Google Workspace services that took up to an additional six minutes to recover. To our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle’s production network has several levels of redundancy and several systems to ensure optimal bandwidth routing. One of our back end control plane elements responsible for calculating optimal paths for bandwidth, consumes snapshot data from a critical element that provides detailed network modeling, including topology, statistics, and forwarding table information. During a routine update to the critical elements snapshot data, an incomplete snapshot was inadvertently shared which removed several sites from the topology map. This caused traffic originating from those sites to be discarded until recovery mechanisms kicked in and correctly reprogrammed all paths. The packet loss caused errors and failures in multiple downstream Google Cloud and Google Workspace services.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle's automation systems mitigated this failure by pushing a complete topology snapshot during the next programming cycle. The proper sites were restored and the network converged by 05:05 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing this type of disruption from reoccurring and is taking the following actions:\n- Input validation in the control plane has been fully activated for the most critical components and is rolling out to remaining components. The bandwidth routing system is now more robust to accommodate unexpectedly large changes in the topology\n- Deploy a fix to the topology system to prevent this cause of incomplete snapshots.\n- The system providing topology input to the control plane will be sharded not to span multiple regions. This will ensure that an erroneous input, if any, will not impact traffic originating from many regions at the same time.\n- Safer sequencing when removing sites from the topology map\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday, 27 February 2023, from 04:58 to 05:12 US/Pacific unless otherwise noted:\n### Google Cloud Platform Services:\n**Apigee:**\nUp to 20% of requests in affected regions experienced timeouts and elevated 5xx error rates in southamerica-east1, us-east1 and us-central1.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\nAffected customers/users experienced increased packet loss for cross region traffic between affected regions: asia-east1, asia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west1, europe-west4, us-central1, us-central2, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west4\n**Cloud Interconnect:**\nAffected customers/users in regions us-east4, asia-southeast1, southamerica-east1, us-east7, us-west4 experienced increased packet loss on their interconnects.\n**BigQuery:**\nAffected customers/users running queries in affected BigQuery regions experienced increased latency and elevated UNAVAILABLE error rates (retriable 503 errors) between 04:58 and 05:10. Regions affected were: aws-us-east-1, azure-eastus2, southamerica-east1, us-multiregion, us-east4, us-east5, us-east7, us-south1.\n**Cloud Dataflow:**\nOverall two regions were impacted: us-central1 and us-east4. ~20% of Dataflow jobs in us-central1 experienced streaming data disruption: no data passed through the Dataflow pipelines for about 13 minutes. No visible impact in us-central1 for Dataflow Batch jobs. For us-east4 the impact was on 55% of Dataflow Streaming jobs and 75% of Dataflow Batch jobs, for about 13 minutes.\n**Cloud Bigtable:**\nAffected customers/users in us-central1, us-east4, and us-west1 experienced unavailable errors (retriable 503 errors) or deadline exceeded (504 errors). 11.3% of customer projects were affected by the issue.\n**Cloud Key Management Service (KMS):**\nAffected customers/users in us-east4, us-east5, us-central1, multi-region us, multi-region nam7, and global experienced reduced availability in the form of retriable 503 (unavailable) and 504 (deadline exceeded) errors across two categories of KMS keys: software and hardware keys. For software keys, 2.4% of customers were affected, across all the regions mentioned above. For hardware keys, the impact was limited to the regions: us-central1, multi-region us and global where 0.7% of customers were affected. During the outage, 0.1% of software requests returned 503 and 504 errors and 0.78% of hardware requests returned 503 and 504 errors. Requests which were not able to reach our servers likely got 503 (unavailable) which means they have retried and eventually succeeded or got a 504 (deadline exceeded) error.\n**Cloud Monitoring:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated latency on Cloud Monitoring dashboards. Customers writing metric data through the Monitoring API experienced elevated error rates.\n**Persistent Disk:**\nAffected customers/users would have seen read, writes, and unmaps stuck. Approximately 0.12% of devices were affected globally. Affected regions were: us-central1, us-east4, southamerica-east1, us-west4, asia-southeast1.\n**Cloud SQL:**\nAffected customers/users may have seen intermittent connectivity issues for ~10 minutes from 05:00-05:10 US/Pacific (us-central1, us-east4, us-west4, southamerica-east1). Retrying should have succeeded, as the success rate was ~80-95% depending on region and method.\n**Cloud Workflows:**\n~1% of (global) requests to the workflow executions API failed. 75% of requests failed in us-west4. 46% of requests failed in us-east4. ~3.5% of requests failed in us-central1. ~2.5% of requests failed in southamerica-east1 and northamerica-northeast2.\n**Cloud Console:**\nAffected customers/users experienced an elevated number of GUI failures. Up to 9% of page views were affected during impact period..\n**Cloud Load Balancing:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated 500 error rates from load balancers for traffic passing through asia-southeast1, us-central1, us-west4.\n**Google Compute Engine:** Affected customers/users experienced elevated 500 error rates when sending HTTP requests to Google Compute Engine APIs. This would also include timeouts when reading or writing GCE metadata guest attributes. Additionally, affected users would have experienced an increase in latency and elevated UNAVAILABLE error rates (retriable 503 errors) between 05:00 am PST and 05:10 am PST for Compute Engine Frontend UI pages.\n**Cloud Run:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases..\n**Cloud App Engine:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases. .\n**Cloud Functions:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases.\n**Cloud VPN:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated packet loss in us-east4, asia-southeast1, southamerica-east1, us-east7, us-west4.\n**Identity and Access Management:**\nAffected customers/users experienced NOT_FOUND, PERMISSION_DENIED, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED and UNAVAILABLE errors.\n**Cloud Pub/Sub:**\nAffected customers/users experienced unavailability and increased latency for Publish operations, with the most severe impact occurring in us-east1, us-east4, and us-east5, where approximately 40% of projects experienced at least one minute in which fewer than 99% of requests succeeded. In most regions, <10% of projects experienced impact. Availability of subscribe operations was also impacted in a similar pattern. In combination with inability of the system to move message data between locations as normal, this led to increased end-to-end message delivery latency for approximately 20% of subscriptions.\n**Google Cloud Storage:**\nOn 2023-02-27, from 04:58 to 05:06 (8 minutes), some GCS customers/users in us-east4 experienced reduced availability in the form of Service Unavailable (retryable) errors at a rate of about 1% overall. Less than 1% of customer projects had an error rate of more than 1%. Some GCS customers in the configurations us-multiregion, us-central1 and us-east1 also experienced an elevated error rate during the impact window that did not exceed 1%.\n**Cloud Firestore:**\nAffected customers/users would have seen increased unavailability errors with Firestore and Datastore API in various regions, including southamerica-east1, us-west4, us-east4, us-east1 and nam5. Globally, around 33% of active customers and 0.38% of active requests received 502 unavailable errors or increased latency between 4:58 and 5:10 US/Pacific.\n**Cloud Data Loss Prevention:**\nNo user impact\n**Cloud Memorystore:** * ***Control Plane:*** Between 4:58 and 5:09 US/Pacific, some customers/users issuing control plane requests (like GetInstance, CreateInstance, etc) experienced a significant increase in latency, and, in ~35% of the cases, - request failures with 5xx error code. The issue was most pronounced in us-east4, us-west4, us-east1, and asia-southeast1 cloud regions, but was noticeable in other regions as well. * ***Data plane:*** Between 5:00 and 5:04 US/Pacific, a number of instances in us-east4, us-west4, southamerica-east1, us-central1, and europe-west2 experienced 1-5 minutes of unavailability, where customers were unable to connect to their Redis server. In many STANDARD-tier instances, this resulted in a failover.\n**Cloud Spanner:**\nOn 2023-02-27, from 04:57 to 05:06 US/Pacific (9 minutes), some customers/users in us-east4, nam3, nam7, nam9, nam11, nam12, nam-eur-asia3 experienced reduced availability in the form of deadline exceeded (retryable) errors and also an increase in latency. Less than 1% of customer projects had an error rate of more than 1%.\n**Cloud Build:**\nCloud Build API customers/users in 2 regions (southamerica-east1 and prod-global) experienced high latency and DEADLINE_EXCEEDED responses. Availability SLO for {Get,List}WorkerPool in southamerica-east1 was down to 13% for 3 minutes and consumed 25% of the 30-day error budget. Availability SLO for ReceiveGitHubDotComWebhook was down to 28% for 3 minutes and consumed 9% of the 30-day error budget.\n**Container Registry:**\nContainer registry customers/users in the global region experienced high latency and HTTP 504 responses. Availability SLO for manifests_get consumed 6% of the 30-day error budget. Availability SLO for ping_and_token_availability consumed 15% of the 30-day error budget.\n**Cloud Tasks:**\nCloud Tasks customers/users in the us-central1 region experienced high latency and DEADLINE_EXCEEDED responses for CreateTasks requests. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) error rate increased from 0 to 10% for 3 minutes.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):**\nGKE customers/users may have experienced service degradation and elevated 500 errors in affected locations.\n### Workspace services\n**Gmail:**\nAffected customers/users would have experienced unavailability, 502 errors when accessing Gmail, and email delivery delays and failures between 04:58 and 05:06 US/Pacific.\n**Google Calendar:**\nAffected customers/users experienced general unavailability when accessing Calendar.\n**Google Chat:**\nAffected customers/users at affected locations experienced errors when attempting to access and use Google Chat.\n**Google Meet:**\nAffected customers/users experienced failure rates of up to 14% when attempting to start or join a new meeting.\n**Google Docs:**\nCustomers/users in affected locations would experience errors when loading or accessing documents.\n**Google Drive:**\nUp to 10% of customers/users accessing Google Drive during the time window experienced unavailability (HTTP 500 errors).\n**Google Tasks**\nAffected customers/users experienced availability issues with tasks.\n**Google Voice:**\nAffected customers/users experienced up to a 2.9% error rate when interacting with Voice API. Up to 2% of Ongoing GV calls may have been dropped. Up to 13% of desk phones may not have been able to make or receive calls during the window and any outgoing calls on these would have been dropped.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, February 27, 2023, Google Cloud Networking’s production network experienced significant packet loss starting 04:58 US/Pacific for a duration of up to seven minutes. This caused errors and failures in several downstream Google Cloud and Google Workspace services that took up to an additional six minutes to recover. To our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle’s production network has several levels of redundancy and several systems to ensure optimal bandwidth routing. One of our back end control plane elements responsible for calculating optimal paths for bandwidth, consumes snapshot data from a critical element that provides detailed network modeling, including topology, statistics, and forwarding table information. During a routine update to the critical elements snapshot data, an incomplete snapshot was inadvertently shared which removed several sites from the topology map. This caused traffic originating from those sites to be discarded until recovery mechanisms kicked in and correctly reprogrammed all paths. The packet loss caused errors and failures in multiple downstream Google Cloud and Google Workspace services.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle's automation systems mitigated this failure by pushing a complete topology snapshot during the next programming cycle. The proper sites were restored and the network converged by 05:05 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing this type of disruption from reoccurring and is taking the following actions:\n- Input validation in the control plane has been fully activated for the most critical components and is rolling out to remaining components. The bandwidth routing system is now more robust to accommodate unexpectedly large changes in the topology\n- Deploy a fix to the topology system to prevent this cause of incomplete snapshots.\n- The system providing topology input to the control plane will be sharded not to span multiple regions. This will ensure that an erroneous input, if any, will not impact traffic originating from many regions at the same time.\n- Safer sequencing when removing sites from the topology map\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday, 27 February 2023, from 04:58 to 05:12 US/Pacific unless otherwise noted:\n### Google Cloud Platform Services:\n**Apigee:**\nUp to 20% of requests in affected regions experienced timeouts and elevated 5xx error rates in southamerica-east1, us-east1 and us-central1.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\nAffected customers/users experienced increased packet loss for cross region traffic between affected regions: asia-east1, asia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west1, europe-west4, us-central1, us-central2, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west4\n**Cloud Interconnect:**\nAffected customers/users in regions us-east4, asia-southeast1, southamerica-east1, us-east7, us-west4 experienced increased packet loss on their interconnects.\n**BigQuery:**\nAffected customers/users running queries in affected BigQuery regions experienced increased latency and elevated UNAVAILABLE error rates (retriable 503 errors) between 04:58 and 05:10. Regions affected were: aws-us-east-1, azure-eastus2, southamerica-east1, us-multiregion, us-east4, us-east5, us-east7, us-south1.\n**Cloud Dataflow:**\nOverall two regions were impacted: us-central1 and us-east4. ~20% of Dataflow jobs in us-central1 experienced streaming data disruption: no data passed through the Dataflow pipelines for about 13 minutes. No visible impact in us-central1 for Dataflow Batch jobs. For us-east4 the impact was on 55% of Dataflow Streaming jobs and 75% of Dataflow Batch jobs, for about 13 minutes.\n**Cloud Bigtable:**\nAffected customers/users in us-central1, us-east4, and us-west1 experienced unavailable errors (retriable 503 errors) or deadline exceeded (504 errors). 11.3% of customer projects were affected by the issue.\n**Cloud Key Management Service (KMS):**\nAffected customers/users in us-east4, us-east5, us-central1, multi-region us, multi-region nam7, and global experienced reduced availability in the form of retriable 503 (unavailable) and 504 (deadline exceeded) errors across two categories of KMS keys: software and hardware keys. For software keys, 2.4% of customers were affected, across all the regions mentioned above. For hardware keys, the impact was limited to the regions: us-central1, multi-region us and global where 0.7% of customers were affected. During the outage, 0.1% of software requests returned 503 and 504 errors and 0.78% of hardware requests returned 503 and 504 errors. Requests which were not able to reach our servers likely got 503 (unavailable) which means they have retried and eventually succeeded or got a 504 (deadline exceeded) error.\n**Cloud Monitoring:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated latency on Cloud Monitoring dashboards. Customers writing metric data through the Monitoring API experienced elevated error rates.\n**Persistent Disk:**\nAffected customers/users would have seen read, writes, and unmaps stuck. Approximately 0.12% of devices were affected globally. Affected regions were: us-central1, us-east4, southamerica-east1, us-west4, asia-southeast1.\n**Cloud SQL:**\nAffected customers/users may have seen intermittent connectivity issues for ~10 minutes from 05:00-05:10 US/Pacific (us-central1, us-east4, us-west4, southamerica-east1). Retrying should have succeeded, as the success rate was ~80-95% depending on region and method.\n**Cloud Workflows:**\n~1% of (global) requests to the workflow executions API failed. 75% of requests failed in us-west4. 46% of requests failed in us-east4. ~3.5% of requests failed in us-central1. ~2.5% of requests failed in southamerica-east1 and northamerica-northeast2.\n**Cloud Console:**\nAffected customers/users experienced an elevated number of GUI failures. Up to 9% of page views were affected during impact period..\n**Cloud Load Balancing:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated 500 error rates from load balancers for traffic passing through asia-southeast1, us-central1, us-west4.\n**Google Compute Engine:** Affected customers/users experienced elevated 500 error rates when sending HTTP requests to Google Compute Engine APIs. This would also include timeouts when reading or writing GCE metadata guest attributes. Additionally, affected users would have experienced an increase in latency and elevated UNAVAILABLE error rates (retriable 503 errors) between 05:00 am PST and 05:10 am PST for Compute Engine Frontend UI pages.\n**Cloud Run:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases..\n**Cloud App Engine:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases. .\n**Cloud Functions:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated error rates (400 or 500 errors), request time outs, and control plane request failures. Retrying the requests may have succeeded in some cases.\n**Cloud VPN:**\nAffected customers/users experienced elevated packet loss in us-east4, asia-southeast1, southamerica-east1, us-east7, us-west4.\n**Identity and Access Management:**\nAffected customers/users experienced NOT_FOUND, PERMISSION_DENIED, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED and UNAVAILABLE errors.\n**Cloud Pub/Sub:**\nAffected customers/users experienced unavailability and increased latency for Publish operations, with the most severe impact occurring in us-east1, us-east4, and us-east5, where approximately 40% of projects experienced at least one minute in which fewer than 99% of requests succeeded. In most regions, <10% of projects experienced impact. Availability of subscribe operations was also impacted in a similar pattern. In combination with inability of the system to move message data between locations as normal, this led to increased end-to-end message delivery latency for approximately 20% of subscriptions.\n**Google Cloud Storage:**\nOn 2023-02-27, from 04:58 to 05:06 (8 minutes), some GCS customers/users in us-east4 experienced reduced availability in the form of Service Unavailable (retryable) errors at a rate of about 1% overall. Less than 1% of customer projects had an error rate of more than 1%. Some GCS customers in the configurations us-multiregion, us-central1 and us-east1 also experienced an elevated error rate during the impact window that did not exceed 1%.\n**Cloud Firestore:**\nAffected customers/users would have seen increased unavailability errors with Firestore and Datastore API in various regions, including southamerica-east1, us-west4, us-east4, us-east1 and nam5. Globally, around 33% of active customers and 0.38% of active requests received 502 unavailable errors or increased latency between 4:58 and 5:10 US/Pacific.\n**Cloud Data Loss Prevention:**\nNo user impact\n**Cloud Memorystore:** * ***Control Plane:*** Between 4:58 and 5:09 US/Pacific, some customers/users issuing control plane requests (like GetInstance, CreateInstance, etc) experienced a significant increase in latency, and, in ~35% of the cases, - request failures with 5xx error code. The issue was most pronounced in us-east4, us-west4, us-east1, and asia-southeast1 cloud regions, but was noticeable in other regions as well. * ***Data plane:*** Between 5:00 and 5:04 US/Pacific, a number of instances in us-east4, us-west4, southamerica-east1, us-central1, and europe-west2 experienced 1-5 minutes of unavailability, where customers were unable to connect to their Redis server. In many STANDARD-tier instances, this resulted in a failover.\n**Cloud Spanner:**\nOn 2023-02-27, from 04:57 to 05:06 US/Pacific (9 minutes), some customers/users in us-east4, nam3, nam7, nam9, nam11, nam12, nam-eur-asia3 experienced reduced availability in the form of deadline exceeded (retryable) errors and also an increase in latency. Less than 1% of customer projects had an error rate of more than 1%.\n**Cloud Build:**\nCloud Build API customers/users in 2 regions (southamerica-east1 and prod-global) experienced high latency and DEADLINE_EXCEEDED responses. Availability SLO for {Get,List}WorkerPool in southamerica-east1 was down to 13% for 3 minutes and consumed 25% of the 30-day error budget. Availability SLO for ReceiveGitHubDotComWebhook was down to 28% for 3 minutes and consumed 9% of the 30-day error budget.\n**Container Registry:**\nContainer registry customers/users in the global region experienced high latency and HTTP 504 responses. Availability SLO for manifests_get consumed 6% of the 30-day error budget. Availability SLO for ping_and_token_availability consumed 15% of the 30-day error budget.\n**Cloud Tasks:**\nCloud Tasks customers/users in the us-central1 region experienced high latency and DEADLINE_EXCEEDED responses for CreateTasks requests.

The rollback is being applied to impacted clusters or is waiting for the user's time specified maintenance window.\nWe will provide an update by Monday, 2023-01-16 09:00 US/Pacific with current details.\nDiagnosis: Horizontal pod autoscaler might not scale workloads within newly created clusters.\nCustomers might observe \"No recommendation \" in the HPA object status.\nWorkaround: Users with time specified maintenance windows can change the window to have the fix applied as soon as possible.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 09 December 2022 04:50\n**Incident End:** 09 December 2022 07:55\n**Duration:** 3 hours, 5 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n- Artifact Registry: New repository creations\n- Google Cloud Composer: Composer environment creations\n- Google Cloud Storage: Operations that check IAM policies, especially CreateBucket\n- Google Kubernetes Engine: New cluster creation\n- Identity and Access Management: Not directly affected, only downstream services.\n**Regions/Zones:** australia-southeast1, asia-east1, asia-east2, asia-northeast1, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-south1, asia-south2, asia-southeast1, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast2, and asia (Google Cloud multi-region).\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) in the Asia multi-region experienced unavailability, which impacted several downstream Google Cloud services for a period of 3 hours and 17 minutes. Customers directly using IAM were not affected. The root cause was related to a configuration change with unintended consequences, which was immediately rolled back, once identified as the problem, thereby restoring services.\n**Customer Impact:**\nArtifact Registry\n- Affected customers would not have been able to create new repositories in the Asia multi-region. Customers would have received a failure message of “Request contains an invalid argument.”\nGoogle Cloud Composer\n- Affected customers in the Asia multi-region were not able to create Composer environments, receiving errors indicating either an issue with AppEngine or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster creation.\nGoogle Cloud Storage\n- Affected customers would have experienced increased error rates when creating buckets in the Asia multi-region. GKE uses Google Cloud multi-regional buckets internally, so regional GKE customers throughout Asia Pacific were affected.\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine\n- Affected customers would have been unable to create new clusters in the affected regions.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 1 December 2022 at 17:30 PT, Google Compute Engine (GCE) customers experienced issues connecting to instances via Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) through Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) [1] for a total duration of 22 hours and 46 minutes. To our GCE customers whose instances were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/iap\n## Background\nIAP assists in securing user access to registered web applications and cloud resources by providing centralized access control. IAP is the default method of connectivity when customers SSH through the Google Cloud Console or `gcloud` tool to GCE instances which do not have external IP addresses. The IAP connection method also can be specified by organization policy or `gcloud` invocation flags.\n## Root Cause\nBefore allowing a connection through SSH, IAP validates the user and connects to a backend system database. That database is used to collect instance and networking information for GCE instances for validation that the instance exists. This database is updated in real-time, as GCE instances are added, changed, or removed.\nDue to an issue with a global index associated with this backend system database, writes to the database were unable to keep up with instance updates from GCE and eventually caused the updates of GCE IAP information to lag. This meant that as new GCE instances were created, they were not being added to the database that IAP accessed. Therefore, IAP was unaware of the GCE instances and thus denied access to them when customers attempted to use SSH through the IAP Proxy.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were initially notified of the issue through a support case on 1 December 2022 at 22:44 PT and immediately started an investigation. At 01:55 PT on 2 December, engineers determined the problem to be an internal system backend database used for instance and networking information for GCE, and the issue was escalated to our database team. Database engineers attempted several mitigations starting at 03:01 PT but experienced limited success.\nAt 11:01 PT, engineers redirected IAP traffic to a standby replica of the system database, which temporarily mitigated the issue at 13:38 PT. At 17:45 PT, the issue recurred, as an existing rollout mistakenly redirected traffic back to the primary database, overriding the non-standard configuration being used to mitigate the issue at the time. Engineers again redirected traffic to the database replica, which fully mitigated and resolved the issue at 20:50 PT.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n1. Make modifications to our alerting practices for IAP SSH to closely monitor the backlog of unprocessed instance creations and updates, enabling us to take corrective actions to mitigate any customer impact.\n2. Refactor our rollout vehicles to provide more fine-grained change deployment, so that unrelated configuration changes do not also deploy core service configuration or binaries for the IAP infrastructure. This will prevent the secondary issue recurrence, which occurred at 17:45 PT.\n3. Improve the performance of concurrent reads and writes to the same database rows by applying exclusive locks, which will serialize those transactions. This will effectively help eliminate transactions from becoming deadlocked and rejected.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 1 December 2022 from 17:30 PT to 2 December 2022 13:11 PT and again from 17:45 PT to 20:50 PT, GCE customers experienced issues connecting to instances via SSH through IAP.\nCustomers attempting to connect to GCE instances created or updated after 1 December 2022 at 17:30 PT using SSH through IAP would have experienced connection failures with “ERROR: (gcloud.compute.start-iap-tunnel) Error while connecting [4047: 'Failed to lookup instance'].”\nThis issue only impacted SSH access, and workloads continued to run correctly. Additionally, connections without IAP and connection to instances that were not modified after 1 December 2022 at 17:30 PT would not have been affected.",

To our GCE customers whose instances were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/iap\n## Background\nIAP assists in securing user access to registered web applications and cloud resources by providing centralized access control. IAP is the default method of connectivity when customers SSH through the Google Cloud Console or `gcloud` tool to GCE instances which do not have external IP addresses. The IAP connection method also can be specified by organization policy or `gcloud` invocation flags.\n## Root Cause\nBefore allowing a connection through SSH, IAP validates the user and connects to a backend system database. That database is used to collect instance and networking information for GCE instances for validation that the instance exists. This database is updated in real-time, as GCE instances are added, changed, or removed.\nDue to an issue with a global index associated with this backend system database, writes to the database were unable to keep up with instance updates from GCE and eventually caused the updates of GCE IAP information to lag. This meant that as new GCE instances were created, they were not being added to the database that IAP accessed. Therefore, IAP was unaware of the GCE instances and thus denied access to them when customers attempted to use SSH through the IAP Proxy.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were initially notified of the issue through a support case on 1 December 2022 at 22:44 PT and immediately started an investigation. At 01:55 PT on 2 December, engineers determined the problem to be an internal system backend database used for instance and networking information for GCE, and the issue was escalated to our database team. Database engineers attempted several mitigations starting at 03:01 PT but experienced limited success.\nAt 11:01 PT, engineers redirected IAP traffic to a standby replica of the system database, which temporarily mitigated the issue at 13:38 PT. At 17:45 PT, the issue recurred, as an existing rollout mistakenly redirected traffic back to the primary database, overriding the non-standard configuration being used to mitigate the issue at the time. Engineers again redirected traffic to the database replica, which fully mitigated and resolved the issue at 20:50 PT.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n1. Make modifications to our alerting practices for IAP SSH to closely monitor the backlog of unprocessed instance creations and updates, enabling us to take corrective actions to mitigate any customer impact.\n2. Refactor our rollout vehicles to provide more fine-grained change deployment, so that unrelated configuration changes do not also deploy core service configuration or binaries for the IAP infrastructure. This will prevent the secondary issue recurrence, which occurred at 17:45 PT.\n3. Improve the performance of concurrent reads and writes to the same database rows by applying exclusive locks, which will serialize those transactions. This will effectively help eliminate transactions from becoming deadlocked and rejected.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 1 December 2022 from 17:30 PT to 2 December 2022 13:11 PT and again from 17:45 PT to 20:50 PT, GCE customers experienced issues connecting to instances via SSH through IAP.\nCustomers attempting to connect to GCE instances created or updated after 1 December 2022 at 17:30 PT using SSH through IAP would have experienced connection failures with “ERROR: (gcloud.compute.start-iap-tunnel) Error while connecting [4047: 'Failed to lookup instance'].”\nThis issue only impacted SSH access, and workloads continued to run correctly. Additionally, connections without IAP and connection to instances that were not modified after 1 December 2022 at 17:30 PT would not have been affected.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** December 1st, 2022 04:10\n**Incident End:** December 1st, 2022 05:19\n**Duration:** 1 hour, 09 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Monitoring\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Monitoring experienced intermittent responses for failed repository data requests for 1 hour and 09 minutes. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a component containing a permission change in database schema in a recent rollout. The issue was mitigated by rolling back to a previous good version in all zones.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Affected customers may have received partial error notifications for repository data requests between 04:10 and 04:29.\n- Between 04:29 and 05:00, customers received complete failures to query repository data.\n- Between 05:00 and 05:19, while systems were recovering, customers received partial error notifications for repository data requests.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 14 November 2022, multiple Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services experienced elevated error rates affecting a small percentage of customers for a duration of 38 minutes and 48 minutes respectively. To our Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Workspace services (for eligible customers) rely on Context-Aware Access [1] and GCP services rely on Access Context Manager [2]. These are a unified set of infrastructure services (henceforth referred to as \"Access Context Manager\") that are responsible for determining what access levels a request has based on the level of trust a company's security policy places in that request. The customer must enable Access Context Manager.\nOn 14 November at 09:25 PT, Google engineers were alerted to an issue in which some background tasks were experiencing resource exhaustion with Access Context Manager, which authorizes enhanced verification access for enterprise customers.\nDuring an initial attempt to resolve the issue, an inadvertent decrease in capacity for the service occurred. This caused authentication traffic to be directed to a small number of tasks, which were unable to handle the load. While internal safeguards successfully isolated the impact to a single data center, thus reducing the impact further, they were unable to stop the service tasks from repeatedly restarting or crashing. In the absence of access-level responses from the system, dependent Google Cloud and Google Workspace services acted correctly and fail-closed, as they are supposed to when they do not have a clear signal that access is permitted.\n- [1] https://support.google.com/a/answer/9275380\n- [2] - https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/overview#:~:text=Access%20Context%20Manager%20allows%20Google,access%20levels%20and%20service%20perimeters\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers redirected traffic away from the affected Access Context Manager infrastructure at 11:19 PT and routed it to data centers that had available capacity to manage load. Service was restored by 11:28 PT for Workspace and 11:38 PT for Google Cloud.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Update Access Context Manager playbooks to include better information on baseline production task configurations to prevent decreasing capacity to unsafe levels and use commands that cannot mistake growing and shrinking.\n- Re-evaluate the review/approval process for Access Context Manager capacity changes to ensure that request reviewers have better visibility into the changes being requested to prevent unintentional reductions in capacity.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nGoogle Workspace Product Impact:\nA small number of users of the following Google Workspace products experienced HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors: Calendar, Tasks, Gmail, Drive, Docs, Meet, Keep, Jamboard, and Chat between 10:50 PT to 11:28 PT. Consumer users were not affected.\n- Calendar, Tasks, Gmail, Drive, Docs, Meet, Keep, Jamboard, Chat: Affected users experienced HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors.\n- Admin Console: Customers' admin consoles displayed generic logos, rather than company specific logos.\n- Groups: Groups User Interface and Settings API served HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors to all users.\nGoogle Cloud Product Impact :\nA small number of users of the following GCP may have experienced increased error rates and unavailability between 10:50 PT to 11:38 PT in the following regions.\n- Google Compute Engine: Affected customers experienced elevated API traffic error rates up to 6% in the following regions: asia-east2, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-northeast 1, asia-south1, asia-south2, asia-southeast1, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast1, europe-west9, and southamerica-east1.\n- Google Cloud Console: Approximately 3% of customers were affected, experiencing increased error rates of up to 0.5%.\n- Resource Manager: Affected customers may have seen elevated error rates up to 2.6% and seen generic status unavailable errors when using the API.\n- Google BigQuery: Affected customers experienced elevated API traffic error rates up to 10% when using the - BigQuery storage read and write APIs in southamerica-west1 and in the BigQuery US multi-region.\n- Cloud Firestore: Up to 7.5% of customer projects experienced elevated latency, operation deadline expirations, and/or error messages that state Policy Checks are unavailable. The impact was restricted to projects hosted in nam5 US multi-region, which includes us-central1.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 14 November 2022, multiple Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services experienced elevated error rates affecting a small percentage of customers for a duration of 38 minutes and 48 minutes respectively. To our Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Workspace services (for eligible customers) rely on Context-Aware Access [1] and GCP services rely on Access Context Manager [2]. These are a unified set of infrastructure services (henceforth referred to as \"Access Context Manager\") that are responsible for determining what access levels a request has based on the level of trust a company's security policy places in that request. The customer must enable Access Context Manager.\nOn 14 November at 09:25 PT, Google engineers were alerted to an issue in which some background tasks were experiencing resource exhaustion with Access Context Manager, which authorizes enhanced verification access for enterprise customers.\nDuring an initial attempt to resolve the issue, an inadvertent decrease in capacity for the service occurred. This caused authentication traffic to be directed to a small number of tasks, which were unable to handle the load. While internal safeguards successfully isolated the impact to a single data center, thus reducing the impact further, they were unable to stop the service tasks from repeatedly restarting or crashing. In the absence of access-level responses from the system, dependent Google Cloud and Google Workspace services acted correctly and fail-closed, as they are supposed to when they do not have a clear signal that access is permitted.\n- [1] https://support.google.com/a/answer/9275380\n- [2] - https://cloud.google.com/access-context-manager/docs/overview#:~:text=Access%20Context%20Manager%20allows%20Google,access%20levels%20and%20service%20perimeters\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers redirected traffic away from the affected Access Context Manager infrastructure at 11:19 PT and routed it to data centers that had available capacity to manage load. Service was restored by 11:28 PT for Workspace and 11:38 PT for Google Cloud.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Update Access Context Manager playbooks to include better information on baseline production task configurations to prevent decreasing capacity to unsafe levels and use commands that cannot mistake growing and shrinking.\n- Re-evaluate the review/approval process for Access Context Manager capacity changes to ensure that request reviewers have better visibility into the changes being requested to prevent unintentional reductions in capacity.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nGoogle Workspace Product Impact:\nA small number of users of the following Google Workspace products experienced HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors: Calendar, Tasks, Gmail, Drive, Docs, Meet, Keep, Jamboard, and Chat between 10:50 PT to 11:28 PT. Consumer users were not affected.\n- Calendar, Tasks, Gmail, Drive, Docs, Meet, Keep, Jamboard, Chat: Affected users experienced HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors.\n- Admin Console: Customers' admin consoles displayed generic logos, rather than company specific logos.\n- Groups: Groups User Interface and Settings API served HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors to all users.\nGoogle Cloud Product Impact :\nA small number of users of the following GCP may have experienced increased error rates and unavailability between 10:50 PT to 11:38 PT in the following regions.\n- Google Compute Engine: Affected customers experienced elevated API traffic error rates up to 6% in the following regions: asia-east2, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-northeast 1, asia-south1, asia-south2, asia-southeast1, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast1, europe-west9, and southamerica-east1.\n- Google Cloud Console: Approximately 3% of customers were affected, experiencing increased error rates of up to 0.5%.\n- Resource Manager: Affected customers may have seen elevated error rates up to 2.6% and seen generic status unavailable errors when using the API.\n- Google BigQuery: Affected customers experienced elevated API traffic error rates up to 10% when using the - BigQuery storage read and write APIs in southamerica-west1 and in the BigQuery US multi-region.\n- Cloud Firestore: Up to 7.5% of customer projects experienced elevated latency, operation deadline expirations, and/or error messages that state Policy Checks are unavailable. The impact was restricted to projects hosted in nam5 US multi-region, which includes us-central1.",

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nThis issue was caused by a recent rollout that was intended to improve maintenance, efficiency, and supportability by sharing internal data requests to new jobs. However, due to an issue in the rollout, the migration of the data resulted in transient faults and caused a failure rate of up to 7% of read and 19% of write traffic in europe-west1.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle Engineers were alerted to this issue and immediately started to investigate the issue.\nEngineers identified the problematic rollout above; however, the first two attempts to roll back this change were not effective to resolve the issue. Google engineers then identified a quicker and more effective, direct mitigation. This change took a couple of minutes to complete and fully mitigated the impact.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is taking the following actions:\n- We have postponed the internal data migration rollout until all critical preventative action measures are resolved.\n- Going forward, we will pause binary rollouts and stop retry updates after Google engineers get alerted to paging events.\n- We will implement a two-stage canary deployment for rollouts to reduce the percentage of impacted tasks due to catastrophic error.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization.

Please see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/setting-vm-host-options for details of the effects of setting automaticRestart to false.\nFor VMs that are terminated, restarting the VM will restore the VM back to a working state.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 24 October 2022 03:00\n**Incident End:** 02 November 2022 20:00\n**Duration:** 9 days, 17 hours\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nVirtual Private Cloud\n**Regions/Zones:** global\n**Description:**\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC) experienced connectivity issues between instances and/or with on-premises machines. In some cases, data plane components in affected regions did not get dynamic routes from peered networks.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a rollout to virtual network controllers. The rollout started on 24 October 2022 to a small subset of controllers and gradually scaled over time to other controllers.\nThe issue was mitigated on 02 November 2022 by rolling back.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers were unable to access their Cloud Volume Service (CVS) storage across GCP Regions.\nCustomers may have faced issues with traffic routing In some cases where dynamic routes were not propagated appropriately on peered networks across regions.",

In some cases, data plane components in affected regions did not get dynamic routes from peered networks.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a rollout to virtual network controllers. The rollout started on 24 October 2022 to a small subset of controllers and gradually scaled over time to other controllers.\nThe issue was mitigated on 02 November 2022 by rolling back.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers were unable to access their Cloud Volume Service (CVS) storage across GCP Regions.\nCustomers may have faced issues with traffic routing In some cases where dynamic routes were not propagated appropriately on peered networks across regions.",

To our BigQuery Storage WriteAPI customers who were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n## Root Cause\nBigQuery Storage Write API is the high-traffic, unified data ingestion API in BigQuery [1].\nOn 13 October 2022 23:30 US/Pacific, there was an unexpected increase of incoming and logging traffic combined with a bug in Google’s internal streaming RPC library that triggered a deadlock and caused the Write API Streaming frontend to be overloaded.\nGoogle’s internal automation correctly kicked in and attempted to resolve the issue by increasing memory and scaling up more instances. But because of the bug in the Write API, the existing instances remained stuck, and because of the effects of load balancing the elevated error rates continued to affect customers accessing the Write API. The fix was to restart the stuck instances which was completed by our engineers.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nThe issue was brought to our attention through internal alert on 13 October 2022 23:47 US/Pacific, and Google engineers immediately started an investigation. Google’s automated systems automatically tried increasing memory on the stuck instances at 13 October 23:40 US/Pacific, and Google engineers manually increased the maximum number of Write API instances from 200 to 1000, however neither of them resolved the issue. Between 14 October 02:30 and 02:50 US/Pacific, Google engineers continued to add resources, until it was discovered that the stuck instances needed to be restarted. This action commenced between 14 October 03:20 US/Pacific and 04:30 US/Pacific. The issue was fully mitigated on 14 October 2022 04:30 US/ Pacific.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\nFix the bug in Google’s internal RPC library (COMPLETED)\nFix the bug in the Write API which caused the cascading deadlock (COMPLETED)\nDeploying additional automation in the Write API back end to automatically load balance based on concurrent connections, at the same time providing improved error handling to reduce unavailability errors.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 13 October 2022 23:30 US/Pacific, customers making calls using Write API in the US Multi-Region observed increased levels of connection failures. Customers making calls using InsertAll API in the US also may have observed a slight increase in failures due to the subsequent increase in traffic.\n**Reference(s):**\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-api",

Google will be providing a full Incident Report to include a finalized root cause and appropriate preventative action items to ensure that this type of outage won’t recur.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 13 October 2022 23:30\n**Incident End:** 14 October 2022 04:30\n**Duration:** 5 hours\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nBigQuery - Storage Write API\n**Regions/Zones:** Multi-Region (US)\n**Description:**\nCustomers making calls to the streaming API using BigQuery observed elevated error rates in US regions for a period of 5 hours. The issue was mitigated by appropriately increasing resources and manually restarting old tasks, which were overloaded with pending connections.\nFrom preliminary analysis, an increase in calls to the Write API, a unified data-ingestion API in BigQuery [1], caused frontend resources to be overloaded. A suboptimal distribution of the load resulted in an elevated error rate. Google engineering is continuing to investigate the matter, and we will publish a final root cause analysis on the Google Cloud Service Health Dashboard as part of a formal Incident Report.\n**Customer Impact:**\nDuring this period of time:\nCustomers making calls using Write API in the US region observed increased levels of connection failures.\nCustomers making calls using InsertAll API in the US region may also have observed a slight increase in failures due to subsequent increase in traffic.\n**Reference(s):**\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-api",

        "text": "Summary: Global: Calico enabled GKE clusters’ pods may get stuck Terminating or Pending after upgrading to 1.22+\nDescription: The following GKE versions are vulnerable to a race condition when using the Calico Network Policy, resulting in pods stuck Terminating or Pending:\nAll 1.22 GKE versions\nAll 1.23 GKE versions\n1.24 versions before 1.24.4-gke.800\nOnly a small number of GKE clusters have actually experienced stuck pods. Use of cluster autoscaler can increase the chance of hitting the race condition.\nA fix is available in GKE v1.24.4-gke.800 or later. The fix is also being made available in v1.23 and v1.22, as part of the next release, which has now started. Once available, customers can manually upgrade to the fixed version. Or, Clusters on the RAPID, REGULAR or STABLE release channels using 1.22 or 1.23 will upgrade automatically over coming weeks.\nWe will provide an update by Friday, 2022-09-30 15:00 US/Pacific with current details.\nThe issue was introduced in the Calico component, and GKE has been working closely with the Calico project to produce a fix. We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.\nDiagnosis: The Calico CNI plugin shows the following error terminating Pods:\n“Warning FailedKillPod 36m (x389 over 121m) kubelet error killing pod: failed to \"KillPodSandbox\" for \"af9ab8f9-d6d6-4828-9b8c-a58441dd1f86\" with KillPodSandboxError: \"rpc error: code = Unknown desc = networkPlugin cni failed to teardown pod \"myclient-pod-6474c76996\" network: error getting ClusterInformation: connection is unauthorized: Unauthorized\"\nWorkaround: Customers currently experiencing the issue, are requested to take one of the following actions:\n1. [Recommended] Manually upgrade to GKE v1.24.4-gke.800 or later (if viable), or reach out to Google Cloud Support to have an internal patch applied\n2. Restart the kubelet and calico-node to get the pods unstuck.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is due to a severed link in Google’s backend network in South America. The issue was mitigated once engineers redirected traffic to alternate links.

Affected customers would have observed partial or absent metric data from this location.\n- Private Uptime Checks were unaffected.\n- Default alert policies against Public Uptime Checks were unaffected.\n- Custom alert policies against Public Uptime Checks may have triggered if a \"metric absence\" condition is present in the policy (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/concepts-indepth#partial-metric-data) and the policy is configured to only measure Uptime metrics from South America.\n---",

From preliminary investigation the root cause appears to be due to a configuration version mismatch, as a result instances operations were never started and would timeout. Google implemented an update to fix the configuration mismatch which restored service and the issue was mitigated 03 October 2022 09:00 US/Pacific.\n**Additional details:**\nSome basic and standard tier instances experienced instance failures like scaling or export with timeouts errors.",

        "text": "# INCIDENT REPORT\n## Summary\nOn Friday, 22 September 2022, Google Cloud experienced a traffic disruption in the wide-area network connecting the us-east1 and us-central1 cloud regions. Inter-region traffic in Google Cloud, and Internet-to-Google Cloud traffic, may have been disrupted if it transited this network path. We are aware of potential impact in several Cloud regions including asia-east1, asia-northeast1, asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-west1, europe-west2, europe-west3, europe-west4, northamerica-northeast1, us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west2, us-west4, as well as to Google Workspace, with a total duration of 22 minutes.\n## Root Cause\nThe traffic disruption in Google's wide-area network was triggered by brief failures in fiber-optic cables, in the presence of a pre-existing failure nearby in the network.\nThese brief failures occurred progressively across a 18-minute period on Friday, 22 September 2022, from 04:28 to 04:46 US/Pacific. Each event required a rerouting of traffic, extending the impact to 04:50.\nThe pre-existing failure occurred on Wednesday, 20 September 2022 22:10 US/Pacific, and was still under repair at the time of the second failure on Friday 22nd September.\nGoogle's interregional backbone is designed with multiple levels of redundancy and is provisioned to reroute Cloud traffic with minimal disruption under all common failure scenarios. In this case, the backbone was designed with appropriate redundancy to survive this dual-failure scenario, but traffic in the affected regions experienced longer rerouting delays. Traffic flowing over other network links experienced disruption as rerouted traffic sought alternate, less congested backup paths.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle's network reacted automatically to the 04:28 to 04:46 events, rerouting within our design goals and fully recovered by 04:50.\nOur network controls software automatically removed the impacted links from service for our engineers to investigate, since unreliable paths cause more short-term impact than failed paths. There was no shortage of capacity at any time; all disruptions were caused by rerouting.\nThe probability and impact of these scenarios is exhaustively modeled to ensure such double\nfailures occur very infrequently and do not exceed long-term (yearly & multi-year) availability targets.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Verify fiber-optic cable maintenance procedures adequately manage the risk of physical interruption during repair and other maintenance activity, including hitless proactive traffic moves where appropriate.\n- Ensuring capacity modeling software is correctly assessing the risk of dual failures, and allowing more headroom for rerouted traffic where those failures are more likely.\n- Ensuring automatic removal of unreliable capacity is acting aggressively enough to avoid areas with progressive failures.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 22 September 2022, between 04:28 to 04:50 US/Pacific unless otherwise noted the following services (but not limited to) may have been impacted for various customers in the following cloud regions: asia-east1, asia-northeast1, asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-west1, europe-west2, europe-west3, europe-west4, northamerica-northeast1, us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west2, us-west4, unless otherwise noted.\n### Google Compute Engine\nAffected Google Compute Engine customers may have experienced increased latency and packet loss between Compute Engine instances in affected regions.\n### Google Cloud BigTable\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls from 04:29 through 04:51 in asia-east1, us-central1, us-south1, us-west1, and us-west4.\n### Google Chat\nAffected Google Chat customers would have experienced errors when accessing, creating, or responding to chats from 04:28 through 04:51.\n### Google Voice\nGoogle Voice users might have experienced some of their actions failing during the impact window due to an internal error. This includes all actions such as sending SMS, placing & receiving calls, loading call history, etc. Affected web, Android, and iOS users.\n### Google Cloud Storage\nA small percentage of Google Cloud Storage customers may have experienced errors in requests to GCS buckets in asia-south2, asia-southeast2, us-west1 and us-west2.\n### Google Cloud Load Balancing\nAffected Google Cloud Load Balancing customers may have experienced increased HTTP 5XX errors. Globally around 3M queries were served with 5XX response during the two outage windows and us-west1, asia-east1, asia-south1, asia-south2 and asia-southeast1 saw the most of the failing queries.",

The issue was fully mitigated on Tuesday, 13 September 2022 at 10:42 US/Pacific.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability of the service in the future.\n**Root Cause:**\nFilestore enforces a global limit on API requests to limit impact in overload scenarios. The outage was triggered when an internal Google service managing a large number of GCP projects malfunctioned and overloaded the Filestore API with requests, causing global throttling of the Filestore API. This continued until the internal service was manually paused.\nAs a result of this throttling, read-only API access was unavailable for all customers. This affected customers in all locations, due to a global quota that applies to Filestore. Console, gcloud and API access (List, GetOperation, etc.) calls all failed for a duration of 3 hours, 12 minutes.\nMutate operations (CreateInstance, UpdateInstance, CreateBackup, etc.) still succeeded, but customers were unable to check on operation progress.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nOur engineers were alerted of the issue through automated alerts on Tuesday, 13 September 2022 07:47 US/Pacific. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers started shutting down the internal service overloading our APIs at 10:33 and the issue was completely resolved at 10:42.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence by implementing the following action items:\n- Removal of the global quotas which resulted in a local overload causing a global impact.\n- Improve alerting and monitoring to respond more promptly when approaching internal limits, improving time to detection and mitigation.\nWe appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Tuesday, 13 September 2022 from 07:30 to 10:42 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Filestore experienced an issue where ListInstances API requests failed with error code 429. This impacted read-only API access for customers globally. Pantheon, gcloud and API access (List, GetOperation, etc.) calls failed during this time. Mutate operations (CreateInstance, UpdateInstance, CreateBackup, etc.) still succeeded, however clients were not able to check on operation progress.",

      "text": "## INCIDENT REPORT ##\n**Summary:**\nOn Tuesday, 13 September 2022 07:30 US/Pacific, an issue with Google Cloud Filestore resulted in all read-only API requests failing for a period of 3 hours, 12 minutes. The issue was fully mitigated on Tuesday, 13 September 2022 at 10:42 US/Pacific.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability of the service in the future.\n**Root Cause:**\nFilestore enforces a global limit on API requests to limit impact in overload scenarios. The outage was triggered when an internal Google service managing a large number of GCP projects malfunctioned and overloaded the Filestore API with requests, causing global throttling of the Filestore API. This continued until the internal service was manually paused.\nAs a result of this throttling, read-only API access was unavailable for all customers. This affected customers in all locations, due to a global quota that applies to Filestore. Console, gcloud and API access (List, GetOperation, etc.) calls all failed for a duration of 3 hours, 12 minutes.\nMutate operations (CreateInstance, UpdateInstance, CreateBackup, etc.) still succeeded, but customers were unable to check on operation progress.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nOur engineers were alerted of the issue through automated alerts on Tuesday, 13 September 2022 07:47 US/Pacific. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers started shutting down the internal service overloading our APIs at 10:33 and the issue was completely resolved at 10:42.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence by implementing the following action items:\n- Removal of the global quotas which resulted in a local overload causing a global impact.\n- Improve alerting and monitoring to respond more promptly when approaching internal limits, improving time to detection and mitigation.\nWe appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Tuesday, 13 September 2022 from 07:30 to 10:42 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Filestore experienced an issue where ListInstances API requests failed with error code 429. This impacted read-only API access for customers globally. Pantheon, gcloud and API access (List, GetOperation, etc.) calls failed during this time. Mutate operations (CreateInstance, UpdateInstance, CreateBackup, etc.) still succeeded, however clients were not able to check on operation progress.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n**Summary:**\nOn Thursday, 25 August 2022, Google Cloud Networking experienced increased latency in us-central1 starting at 25 August 2022 01:29 for a duration of 1 hour and 1 minute. This caused errors and failures in several downstream services. To our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking utilizes physical routers to aggregate traffic across our network. Periodically, these routers need to be rebooted for various maintenance activities. Google regularly deploys updates to our network control plane to enhance performance, security, and reliability. We also take steps to ensure these reboots take place in a way that minimizes any downtime or customer impact by moving traffic away from the device before the reboot.\nDuring routine maintenance, and after draining existing network traffic, one of the routers being rebooted in us-central1 failed to boot from the primary boot media. Instead, it booted from the alternative boot media, which contained an outdated configuration that was missing updated routing information. That configuration caused the router to attract traffic that it was unable to route correctly. The changes in the network since the outdated configuration meant that our existing fail-safe to make the router take itself out of service again was ineffective.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nThis failure was automatically remediated by Google’s automation systems by pushing the updated configuration on Thursday, 25 August 2022, 02:21 US/Pacific. The proper routes were restored by 02:30. The configuration push is one of the steps taken by automation before closing on the maintenance.\nGoogle is committed to preventing this type of disruption from reoccurring and is taking the follow actions:\nComplete an audit of old router configurations and remove them, and prevent them from accidentally being re-enabled. This is expected to be completed by 9 September 2022.\nDeploy additional monitoring to notify Google engineers when a device is expected to be out of service (i.e. drained) but is re-attracting traffic to reduce future outage durations. This will be rolled out by 30 September 2022.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Thursday, 25 August 2022, from 01:29 to 02:30 US/Pacific unless otherwise noted:\n## Cloud Pub/Sub ##\nCustomers in us-central1 experienced reduced availability in the form of http 502 and 503 (retriable) errors across both publish and subscribe (Pub/Sub) operations. Less than 1% of customer projects were affected. Backlog statistics freshness was also impacted with less than 1% of subscriptions experiencing stale backlog data.\n## Google Compute Engine (GCE) ##\nAll GCE Compute API globally would have experienced a 20% rate of errors or requests hanging. Retries would have helped to get a successful request. Additionally, 50% of the compute.instance.insert operations in the us-central1-a zone succeeded.\n## Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) ##\nAffected Cloud KMS customers would receive errors in nam-eur-asia1, nam7, nam9, nam10, nam11, and nam12 for a small subset of methods. Approximately 3% of requests over the impact period would see an Unavailable error.\n## Cloud Bigtable ##\nLess than 2% of Cloud Bigtable customers (approximately 10% of requests) experienced elevated latency and errors in the Data API and Admin API from 01:29 to 2:30 on 25 August in us-central1. The disruption also impacted users of Key Visualizer for Cloud Bigtable during this time.\n## Cloud DataFlow ##\nDuring the incident (01:29 to 02:30 PT), affected customers may have been temporarily unable to create new DataFlow jobs, both Batch and Streaming (~2% of all customer projects). Information about existing jobs may have been temporarily unavailable (~57.5% of all customer projects). Some Streaming jobs may have been stuck (~4.2% of us-central1 Streaming jobs).\n## Google Cloud Storage ##\nApproximately 0.5% of customer uploads and downloads saw authentication errors during the impact period of 01:31 PDT to 02:24 PDT. Customers would have experienced errors indicating deadline exceeded.\n## Cloud Spanner ##\nLess than 5% of Cloud Spanner customers (approximately 15% of requests) experienced elevated latency and errors in the Data API and Admin API from 01:29 to 2:30 on 25 August in us-central1.\n## Cloud Load Balancing\nAffected customers using cloud load balancing products would have been unable to submit configuration changes in us-central1 between 01:29 to 2:30. Already configured load balancers would continue serving traffic.\n## Service Directory ##\n10 - 20% of registration operations and 0.2% of resolve operations to Service Directory in us-central1 failed during the affected period.",

Each region’s index is dynamically built from data, and then acts as a routing layer for all queries. The index is authoritative, and without it, queries will fail or return empty results.\n**SUMMARY:**\nOn Saturday, 20 August 2022 starting at 05:25 US/Pacific, some Cloud Monitoring queries and metrics were unavailable for multiple Google Cloud products (Google Compute Engine, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud AppEngine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Run) for a period of 2 hours and 55 minutes. Google Compute Engine (GCE) Autoscaling (for virtual machines on GCE) may have been impacted during the incident, as it relies on the Cloud Monitoring metrics.\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nAn increase in storage layer tasks triggered a previously unknown bug in the indexing service. All instances of the indexing service in the us-central1 and us-central2 regions repeatedly crashed and were unable to provide routing lookups to any queries. As a result, Cloud Monitoring queries did not retrieve data stored in us-central1 and us-central2 or failed in a smaller fraction of cases.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle Engineers were first alerted to the issue Saturday, 20 August 2022 at 05:33 US/Pacific by internal monitoring systems. The issue was then mitigated by reducing the number of storage layer tasks. Services were fully recovered at 08:20 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing future issues like this and is completing the following actions to prevent a recurrence:\n- Enhancing the indexing service to support a larger number of tasks (beyond the current threshold).\n- Improving testing to ensure we detect any similar limitations in the future before they reach production.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to improve reliability in the future.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 20 Aug 2022 05:25\n**Incident End:** 20 Aug 2022 08:20\n**Duration:** 2 hours, 55 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Compute Engine, Cloud Spanner, Google Cloud Dataflow, Google Cloud Bigtable, Cloud AppEngine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Run, Operations, Cloud Monitoring\n**Regions/Zones:** us-central1 and us-central2\n**Description:**\nCloud Monitoring metrics for multiple Google Cloud products (Google Compute Engine, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud AppEngine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Run) were missing for a period of 2 hours and 55 minutes. During the same period of time, Google Compute Engine (GCE) Autoscaling (for virtual machines on GCE) also was not functioning, as it relies on the Cloud Monitoring metrics.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was an overload in the system that is responsible for handling the metrics in Cloud Monitoring. This resulted in the failure of the queries which provide these metrics.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers lost their ability to comprehensively observe various cloud operations at scale for the impacted services. Customers who use these metrics retroactively may be missing this information for the duration of the impact. While the custom metrics will be available again, a few that are system-generated shall not be available any more due to system limitations.\n**Additional details:**\nThe issue was mitigated by reducing the number of storage layer tasks. To prevent recurrence, engineers are also actively working on bolstering the system responsible for handling metrics to support a larger number of tasks (beyond the current threshold).",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n**Summary:**\nOn Monday, 25 July 2022, a problem with Google Cloud Billing resulted in incomplete reporting data in the Billing Console for a duration of 9 days, 9 hours and 5 minutes. Invoices were not impacted during the outage. To our customers whose operations were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize – this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle periodically rolls out updates to its products to improve performance and reliability, and to add new functionality. On Monday, 25 July 2022 07:08 US/Pacific, a rollout to Google Compute Engine (GCE) resulted in a change to usage data which created a mismatch in customer billing information and eventually delayed reporting.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the delay in usage reporting through automated monitoring on Tuesday, 26 July 2022 at 01:10 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers began rolling out a fix on Tuesday, 26 July 2022 at 20:29. However, during the mitigation engineers identified a second issue, which manifested as duplicated results and overbilled charges displayed for 25 July, 26 July, and 27 July.\nAt 15:27 on Wednesday, 27 July 2022, having found the root cause of the problem Google engineers suspended the relevant GCE rollout and developed a fix to correct the duplicated results. On Thursday, 28 July 2022, Google engineers continued to work on mitigation efforts and completed a comprehensive manual verification of the fix before pushing it to production. On Friday, 29 July 2022, engineers resumed the billing system to reprocess the customer usage data. In parallel, engineers observed a failure in billing reporting due to the large amount of queued corrections.\nThe incident was fully mitigated on Wednesday, 03 August 2022 09:47 US/Pacific, once the correction process completed across all systems.\nThere was no impact to July invoices, which were issued on Monday, 01 August 2022.\nGoogle is committed to preventing future issues like this and is completing the following actions to ensure there is not a recurrence:\n- Implement validation checks to detect the duplicated results that were passed to downstream systems, causing the second issue.\n- Implement end-to-end testing to cover critical user journeys across GCE, Billing, and Invoicing.\n- Implement a change detection program to identify backward incompatible events from GCE to Billing to prevent transient incorrect billing results.\n- Update the GCE rollout procedure to minimize impact when rolling out a new global billing capability for GCE.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\n## Google Compute Engine (GCE), including Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Google App Engine Flex (GAE):\n- 100% of GCE, GAE Flex, and GKE customers may have experienced delays in viewing real-time product usage information in the Cloud Billing Console or in BigQuery export, if used.\n- Cloud Billing usage reporting experienced issues and may have shown inaccurate or incomplete data. - Some customers may have seen up to double their instance usage being billed.",

From preliminary analysis this was due to an issue with a recent rollout to the Google Compute Engine (GCE) control plane. The rollout produced unforeseen data change that caused a mismatch in Billing, and eventually a delay in the usage reporting.\nComplete Usage data for all days in July are now available in the Cloud Billing Console and BigQuery Export. There was no impact to the invoices for July, which were issued on 1 August 2022.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected customers experienced the following: - Customers may have experienced delays in viewing real-time product usage information in the Cloud Billing Console or in BigQuery export, if used. - Cloud Billing usage reporting experienced issues and may have shown inaccurate or incomplete data. - Some customers may have seen up to double their instance usage being billed.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n**Summary:**\nOn Monday, 25 July 2022, a problem with Google Cloud Billing resulted in incomplete reporting data in the Billing Console for a duration of 9 days, 9 hours and 5 minutes. Invoices were not impacted during the outage. To our customers whose operations were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize – this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle periodically rolls out updates to its products to improve performance and reliability, and to add new functionality. On Monday, 25 July 2022 07:08 US/Pacific, a rollout to Google Compute Engine (GCE) resulted in a change to usage data which created a mismatch in customer billing information and eventually delayed reporting.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the delay in usage reporting through automated monitoring on Tuesday, 26 July 2022 at 01:10 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers began rolling out a fix on Tuesday, 26 July 2022 at 20:29. However, during the mitigation engineers identified a second issue, which manifested as duplicated results and overbilled charges displayed for 25 July, 26 July, and 27 July.\nAt 15:27 on Wednesday, 27 July 2022, having found the root cause of the problem Google engineers suspended the relevant GCE rollout and developed a fix to correct the duplicated results. On Thursday, 28 July 2022, Google engineers continued to work on mitigation efforts and completed a comprehensive manual verification of the fix before pushing it to production. On Friday, 29 July 2022, engineers resumed the billing system to reprocess the customer usage data. In parallel, engineers observed a failure in billing reporting due to the large amount of queued corrections.\nThe incident was fully mitigated on Wednesday, 03 August 2022 09:47 US/Pacific, once the correction process completed across all systems.\nThere was no impact to July invoices, which were issued on Monday, 01 August 2022.\nGoogle is committed to preventing future issues like this and is completing the following actions to ensure there is not a recurrence:\n- Implement validation checks to detect the duplicated results that were passed to downstream systems, causing the second issue.\n- Implement end-to-end testing to cover critical user journeys across GCE, Billing, and Invoicing.\n- Implement a change detection program to identify backward incompatible events from GCE to Billing to prevent transient incorrect billing results.\n- Update the GCE rollout procedure to minimize impact when rolling out a new global billing capability for GCE.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\n## Google Compute Engine (GCE), including Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Google App Engine Flex (GAE):\n- 100% of GCE, GAE Flex, and GKE customers may have experienced delays in viewing real-time product usage information in the Cloud Billing Console or in BigQuery export, if used.\n- Cloud Billing usage reporting experienced issues and may have shown inaccurate or incomplete data. - Some customers may have seen up to double their instance usage being billed.",

        "text": "## Incident Report\n**Summary:**\nOn Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 06:33 US/Pacific, a simultaneous failure of multiple, redundant cooling systems in one of the data centers that hosts the zone europe-west2-a impacted multiple Google Cloud services. This resulted in some customers experiencing service unavailability for impacted products.\nTo our customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps (detailed in the **Remediation & Prevention** section below) to improve the region's resilience.\n***Regional Impact***\nA number of regional Google Cloud services experienced impact during this incident, despite regional services being designed to survive the failure of a single zone. Upon investigation we have found two key contributing factors which led to these regional impacts: * At the start of the incident, we inadvertently modified traffic routing for internal services to avoid all three zones in the europe-west2 region, rather than just the impacted europe-west2-a zone. We corrected this on 19 July 2022 at 12:35 US/Pacific. * Our regional storage services, including GCS and BigQuery, replicate customer data across multiple zones. Due to the regional traffic routing change, they were unable to access any replica for a number of storage objects. This prevented customers from reading these objects until the traffic routing was corrected, at which point access was immediately restored.\n***Cooling System Impact Duration***\nGoogle engineers powered down the data center that hosted a portion of the impacted zone europe-west2-a on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 10:05 US/Pacific while the cooling system was repaired. The cooling system was repaired at 14:13 US/Pacific. The total duration of the cooling system failure impact was 4 hours, 8 minutes.\n***Cloud Service Restoration Duration***\nGoogle engineers began service restoration once the cooling system was repaired on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 14:13 US/Pacific. Cloud services were restored to operation by Wednesday, 20 July 2022 at 04:28 US/Pacific.\nThe duration of impact on Cloud services spans the window from 10:05 US/Pacific on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 (when a portion of europe-west2-a was powered down), to 04:28 US/Pacific on Wednesday, 20 July 2022, when Cloud services were restored; a total of 18 hours, 23 minutes.\n***Long Tail Duration***\nAfter the initial restoration of service to the zone, a small number of Google Compute Engine instances required additional work by our engineers to restore them to normal operations. This manifested as unavailable instances in GCE, and unavailable instances in products and services that rely on Google Compute Engine, such as Cloud SQL. This was fully mitigated on Wednesday, 20 July 2022 at 21:20 US/Pacific and the incident was closed with all services restored.\nFor the instances in this long tail, impact duration spans the window from the initial power down (at 10:05 US/Pacific on Tuesday, 19 July 2022) to the eventual full mitigation (at 21:20 US/Pacific on Wednesday, 20 July 2022); a total of 35 hours, 15 minutes.\nGoogle is conducting a detailed analysis of the systems and processes involved in both the cooling failure and the service recovery, with specific followup AIs identified below.\n**Root Cause:**\nOne of the data centers that hosts zone europe-west2-a could not maintain a safe operating temperature due to a simultaneous failure of multiple, redundant cooling systems combined with the extraordinarily high outside temperatures. We powered down this part of the zone to prevent an even longer outage or damage to machines. This caused a partial failure of capacity in that zone, leading to instance terminations, service degradation, and networking issues for a subset of customers.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to an issue affecting two cooling systems in one of the data centers that hosts europe-west2-a on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 06:33 US/Pacific and began an investigation. Engineers were engaged at 07:02 and began assessing viable mitigations. At 10:05, our engineers decided to power down servers in the impacted data center within europe-west2-a to prevent an even longer outage and further impact to infrastructure in the zone.\nThe cooling system was repaired at 14:13, and we restored our services by Wednesday, 20 July 2022, at 04:28 US/Pacific. A small subset of customers experienced residual effects which were fully mitigated by 21:20.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a future recurrence and improving recovery times by taking the following actions: * A small number of services experienced problems in zonal failover automation. We will repair and carefully re-test our failover automation to ensure stronger resilience in our failover protocols during large scale events such as this one. * We will investigate and develop more advanced methods to progressively decrease the thermal load within a single data center space, reducing the probability that a full shutdown is required. * Our initial recovery of impacted services once cooling was restored was 14 hours, 15 minutes. Additionally, the recovery of the long tail of impacted Google Compute Engine instances and related services was an additional 16 hours, 52 minutes. We are examining our procedures, tooling, and automated recovery systems for gaps to substantially improve our recovery times in the future. * Google engineers are actively conducting a detailed analysis of the cooling system failure that triggered this incident. * Google engineers will be conducting an audit of cooling system equipment and standards across the data centers that house Google Cloud globally.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 06:33 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 21:20 US/Pacific, some customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted location as detailed below:\n**Infrastructure Services**\n* **Google Compute Engine:** As data center temperatures started to increase, on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 08:06 US/Pacific Compute Engine terminated 42% of the Preemptible VMs (PVMs) across the europe-west2 region to reduce thermal load in zone europe-west2-a and ensure space for zonal failover activities in zones europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c. When we proceeded to power down the impacted data center to mitigate the cooling overload on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 10:07 US/Pacific, Compute Engine terminated all VMs in the impacted data center, representing approximately 35% of the VMs in the europe-west2-a zone. We were able to re-enable PVM launches in the running europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c zones at 13:50 US/Pacific. Power was restored on 19 July 2022 at 14:13 US/Pacific, at which point we began the recovery process for Compute Engine. To ensure a safe restoration, the team carefully sequenced the startup of the services powering Compute Engine. This process completed and the majority of VMs came back online starting at 20:18 US/Pacific. We enabled PVMs once the majority of the other VMs were running at 21:27 US/Pacific.The total impact duration was 12 hours, 12 minutes. A small number of VMs (approximately 0.6% of the europe-west2-a zone) encountered conflicts in our control plane state, requiring a manual reconciliation process. We completed this reconciliation for the “long tail” of all VMs on Thursday, 21 July 2022 at 02:32 US/Pacific. A small number of control plane requests to delete missing VMs during the incident required manual resolution, which was completed at 15:50 US/Pacific. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Thursday, 21 July 2022 20:18 US/Pacific\n* **Persistent Disk (PD):** Approximately 38% of Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a were unavailable from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:13 US/Pacific. Affected customers would observe unresponsive disks or I/O errors. In most cases, the GCE instances using these volumes were terminated shortly afterward, but about 1% of the unavailable Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a were attached to instances that remained online throughout the incident. Approximately 96% of Persistent Disk volumes recovered automatically by 20:30 US/Pacific, but the remainder required additional work to recover, which completed on Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:10 US/Pacific. Additionally, about 11% of Regional Persistent Disk volumes in the europe-west2 region experienced high disk latency at the beginning of the incident. Most of the Regional Persistent Disk volumes successfully detected the fault in zone europe-west2-a and switched to unreplicated mode, but about 8% of Regional Persistent Disk volumes in the europe-west2 region were unable to correctly detect the fault until the Persistent Disk team forced them into unreplicated mode, which completed around 11:50 US/Pacific. About 17% of Regional Persistent Disk customers in the europe-west2 region experienced errors performing control plane operations, including creating, deleting, attaching, detaching, and snapshotting Regional Persistent Disk volumes from 19 July 2022 07:18 US/Pacific to 13:40 US/Pacific as an unintended side effect of mitigation efforts. As a result of mitigation efforts, 38% of customers were unable to create new Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 11:16 US/Pacific to 20 July 2022 02:56 US/Pacific. Additionally, 48% of customers were unable to create new Persistent Disk volumes in zones europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:23 US/Pacific to 11:36 US/Pacific. The Persistent Disk snapshot service was unavailable for 38% of customers in zone europe-west2-a from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 08:11 US/Pacific to 21:29 US/Pacific. During this time, affected customers could not create new Persistent Disk snapshots from disks located in zone europe-west2-a nor restore snapshots and disk images to disks in zone europe-west2-a. The total impact duration was 12 hours, 16 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:10 US/Pacific\n* **Google Cloud Storage:** On Tuesday, 19 July 2022 between 07:18 and 08:54 US/Pacific, ReadObject availability for buckets located in europe-west2 dropped to approximately 86%, and the entire region's availability to 96%. This impacted 24% of customer projects within this region. Customers would have received HTTP 500s when reading previously written data. All other operations, as well as read for new ingress, or data that was outside of the affected zones were not impacted. The total impact duration was 96 minutes. Google Cloud Storage (GCS) stores replicas in at least 2 independent colossus clusters. As a regional (not zonal) product, GCS leverages placement algorithms to ensure locations, network, and data center diversity when selecting colossus clusters [1]. There was a legacy placement algorithm isolated to just the europe-west2 region allowing for three colossus clusters in the region to be impacted by the same underlying issue relating to a single data center. In a small number of cases GCS had replicated regional data residing in two offline clusters, and subsequently some customers were unable to access and read some of their existing regional scoped data when the regional clusters were taken offline. Writes and other operations were not impacted.

This resulted in some customers experiencing service unavailability for impacted products.\nTo our customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps (detailed in the **Remediation & Prevention** section below) to improve the region's resilience.\n***Regional Impact***\nA number of regional Google Cloud services experienced impact during this incident, despite regional services being designed to survive the failure of a single zone. Upon investigation we have found two key contributing factors which led to these regional impacts: * At the start of the incident, we inadvertently modified traffic routing for internal services to avoid all three zones in the europe-west2 region, rather than just the impacted europe-west2-a zone. We corrected this on 19 July 2022 at 12:35 US/Pacific. * Our regional storage services, including GCS and BigQuery, replicate customer data across multiple zones. Due to the regional traffic routing change, they were unable to access any replica for a number of storage objects. This prevented customers from reading these objects until the traffic routing was corrected, at which point access was immediately restored.\n***Cooling System Impact Duration***\nGoogle engineers powered down the data center that hosted a portion of the impacted zone europe-west2-a on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 10:05 US/Pacific while the cooling system was repaired. The cooling system was repaired at 14:13 US/Pacific. The total duration of the cooling system failure impact was 4 hours, 8 minutes.\n***Cloud Service Restoration Duration***\nGoogle engineers began service restoration once the cooling system was repaired on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 14:13 US/Pacific. Cloud services were restored to operation by Wednesday, 20 July 2022 at 04:28 US/Pacific.\nThe duration of impact on Cloud services spans the window from 10:05 US/Pacific on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 (when a portion of europe-west2-a was powered down), to 04:28 US/Pacific on Wednesday, 20 July 2022, when Cloud services were restored; a total of 18 hours, 23 minutes.\n***Long Tail Duration***\nAfter the initial restoration of service to the zone, a small number of Google Compute Engine instances required additional work by our engineers to restore them to normal operations. This manifested as unavailable instances in GCE, and unavailable instances in products and services that rely on Google Compute Engine, such as Cloud SQL. This was fully mitigated on Wednesday, 20 July 2022 at 21:20 US/Pacific and the incident was closed with all services restored.\nFor the instances in this long tail, impact duration spans the window from the initial power down (at 10:05 US/Pacific on Tuesday, 19 July 2022) to the eventual full mitigation (at 21:20 US/Pacific on Wednesday, 20 July 2022); a total of 35 hours, 15 minutes.\nGoogle is conducting a detailed analysis of the systems and processes involved in both the cooling failure and the service recovery, with specific followup AIs identified below.\n**Root Cause:**\nOne of the data centers that hosts zone europe-west2-a could not maintain a safe operating temperature due to a simultaneous failure of multiple, redundant cooling systems combined with the extraordinarily high outside temperatures. We powered down this part of the zone to prevent an even longer outage or damage to machines. This caused a partial failure of capacity in that zone, leading to instance terminations, service degradation, and networking issues for a subset of customers.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to an issue affecting two cooling systems in one of the data centers that hosts europe-west2-a on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 06:33 US/Pacific and began an investigation. Engineers were engaged at 07:02 and began assessing viable mitigations. At 10:05, our engineers decided to power down servers in the impacted data center within europe-west2-a to prevent an even longer outage and further impact to infrastructure in the zone.\nThe cooling system was repaired at 14:13, and we restored our services by Wednesday, 20 July 2022, at 04:28 US/Pacific. A small subset of customers experienced residual effects which were fully mitigated by 21:20.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a future recurrence and improving recovery times by taking the following actions: * A small number of services experienced problems in zonal failover automation. We will repair and carefully re-test our failover automation to ensure stronger resilience in our failover protocols during large scale events such as this one. * We will investigate and develop more advanced methods to progressively decrease the thermal load within a single data center space, reducing the probability that a full shutdown is required. * Our initial recovery of impacted services once cooling was restored was 14 hours, 15 minutes. Additionally, the recovery of the long tail of impacted Google Compute Engine instances and related services was an additional 16 hours, 52 minutes. We are examining our procedures, tooling, and automated recovery systems for gaps to substantially improve our recovery times in the future. * Google engineers are actively conducting a detailed analysis of the cooling system failure that triggered this incident. * Google engineers will be conducting an audit of cooling system equipment and standards across the data centers that house Google Cloud globally.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 06:33 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 21:20 US/Pacific, some customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted location as detailed below:\n**Infrastructure Services**\n* **Google Compute Engine:** As data center temperatures started to increase, on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 08:06 US/Pacific Compute Engine terminated 42% of the Preemptible VMs (PVMs) across the europe-west2 region to reduce thermal load in zone europe-west2-a and ensure space for zonal failover activities in zones europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c. When we proceeded to power down the impacted data center to mitigate the cooling overload on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 10:07 US/Pacific, Compute Engine terminated all VMs in the impacted data center, representing approximately 35% of the VMs in the europe-west2-a zone. We were able to re-enable PVM launches in the running europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c zones at 13:50 US/Pacific. Power was restored on 19 July 2022 at 14:13 US/Pacific, at which point we began the recovery process for Compute Engine. To ensure a safe restoration, the team carefully sequenced the startup of the services powering Compute Engine. This process completed and the majority of VMs came back online starting at 20:18 US/Pacific. We enabled PVMs once the majority of the other VMs were running at 21:27 US/Pacific.The total impact duration was 12 hours, 12 minutes. A small number of VMs (approximately 0.6% of the europe-west2-a zone) encountered conflicts in our control plane state, requiring a manual reconciliation process. We completed this reconciliation for the “long tail” of all VMs on Thursday, 21 July 2022 at 02:32 US/Pacific. A small number of control plane requests to delete missing VMs during the incident required manual resolution, which was completed at 15:50 US/Pacific. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Thursday, 21 July 2022 20:18 US/Pacific\n* **Persistent Disk (PD):** Approximately 38% of Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a were unavailable from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:13 US/Pacific. Affected customers would observe unresponsive disks or I/O errors. In most cases, the GCE instances using these volumes were terminated shortly afterward, but about 1% of the unavailable Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a were attached to instances that remained online throughout the incident. Approximately 96% of Persistent Disk volumes recovered automatically by 20:30 US/Pacific, but the remainder required additional work to recover, which completed on Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:10 US/Pacific. Additionally, about 11% of Regional Persistent Disk volumes in the europe-west2 region experienced high disk latency at the beginning of the incident. Most of the Regional Persistent Disk volumes successfully detected the fault in zone europe-west2-a and switched to unreplicated mode, but about 8% of Regional Persistent Disk volumes in the europe-west2 region were unable to correctly detect the fault until the Persistent Disk team forced them into unreplicated mode, which completed around 11:50 US/Pacific. About 17% of Regional Persistent Disk customers in the europe-west2 region experienced errors performing control plane operations, including creating, deleting, attaching, detaching, and snapshotting Regional Persistent Disk volumes from 19 July 2022 07:18 US/Pacific to 13:40 US/Pacific as an unintended side effect of mitigation efforts. As a result of mitigation efforts, 38% of customers were unable to create new Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 11:16 US/Pacific to 20 July 2022 02:56 US/Pacific. Additionally, 48% of customers were unable to create new Persistent Disk volumes in zones europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:23 US/Pacific to 11:36 US/Pacific. The Persistent Disk snapshot service was unavailable for 38% of customers in zone europe-west2-a from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 08:11 US/Pacific to 21:29 US/Pacific. During this time, affected customers could not create new Persistent Disk snapshots from disks located in zone europe-west2-a nor restore snapshots and disk images to disks in zone europe-west2-a. The total impact duration was 12 hours, 16 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:10 US/Pacific\n* **Google Cloud Storage:** On Tuesday, 19 July 2022 between 07:18 and 08:54 US/Pacific, ReadObject availability for buckets located in europe-west2 dropped to approximately 86%, and the entire region's availability to 96%. This impacted 24% of customer projects within this region. Customers would have received HTTP 500s when reading previously written data. All other operations, as well as read for new ingress, or data that was outside of the affected zones were not impacted. The total impact duration was 96 minutes. Google Cloud Storage (GCS) stores replicas in at least 2 independent colossus clusters. As a regional (not zonal) product, GCS leverages placement algorithms to ensure locations, network, and data center diversity when selecting colossus clusters [1]. There was a legacy placement algorithm isolated to just the europe-west2 region allowing for three colossus clusters in the region to be impacted by the same underlying issue relating to a single data center. In a small number of cases GCS had replicated regional data residing in two offline clusters, and subsequently some customers were unable to access and read some of their existing regional scoped data when the regional clusters were taken offline. Writes and other operations were not impacted.

Affected customers observed 5xx responses from their API Gateways. The total impact duration was 6 hours, 40 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 14:00 US/Pacific.\n* **Cloud Bigtable:** ~70% of unreplicated Bigtable instances in europe-west2-a experienced 100% data plane unavailability from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:05 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 02:20 US/Pacific. We observed failed control plane operations for 11% of instances that contained a replica in the europe-west2-a zone. Customers with replicated bigtables in europe-west2-a/b/c using Multi-Cluster routing may have seen increased latencies due to traffic failing over to other regions. The total impact duration was 19 hours, 15 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 02:20 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Composer:** Cloud Composer environments (data-plane side) and operations (control-plane side) experienced degraded performance in europe-west2 on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 09:00 to 22:30 US/Pacific. Control plane operations experienced high failure rates (failure rate reached 100% at the peak). The number of Composer environments reporting a normal, operational state dropped by ~37%. Total capacity of all environments in the region (measured by the total number of tasks being executed in the whole region) was significantly reduced and the drop reached ~50% at the peak. The total impact duration was 13 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 22:30 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Data Fusion:** ~20% of Data Fusion Instances in europe-west2 experienced service degradation, ranging from logs and metrics not being updated to complete loss of availability of their instance on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:15 to 21:30 US/Pacific. ~5% of instances were usable during the impact duration. The total impact duration was 11 hours, 15 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:30 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Datastore:** Customers may have experienced timeouts and degraded service on approximately 1% of writes in the europe-west2 Datastore instance. The total impact duration was 9 hours, 25 minutes, on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from approximately 12:30 to 19:30 US/Pacific. Approximately 40% of customers experienced significant latency increase on query operations from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:45 to 12:45 US/Pacific. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 19:30 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Dataproc:** On Tuesday, 19 July 2022, from 08:00 US/Pacific to 22:00 US/Pacific, customers experienced increased error rates in creating and scaling up clusters in europe-west2. About 24% of CREATE operations and 13% of UPDATE operations were affected. Due to a backlog of queued requests requiring manual attention, error rates for old CREATE/DELETE requests remained elevated until Thursday, 21 July 2022 16:45 US/Pacific (this did not impact availability of already-running clusters). Some Dataproc clusters that were allocated in the impacted zone were unavailable during power down. Most of these came up by 19 July 2022 22:00 US/Pacific. By this time, CREATE operations in all zones began working. A few existing clusters were impacted by the long tail recovery in Google Compute Engine and were restored when that effort completed on Thursday, 21 July 2022 02:32 US/Pacific. Primary impact duration was approximately 14 hours. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 22:00 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Firestore:** Firestore streaming (listen, write) requests via Webchannel were 100% unavailable in the europe-west2 instance on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 07:15 to 09:55 US/Pacific. The total impact duration was 2 hours, 40 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:55 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Secret Manager** Cloud Secret Manager experienced an outage for secrets that were exclusively stored in europe-west2 from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:29 to 08:46 US/Pacific. Secret Manager is a global service that lets users define in which regions to store a given secret. The regional service instances for europe-west2 were deployed in the impacted data center. The total impact duration was 1 hour, 17 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 08:46 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Spanner:** A more comprehensive investigation into our Cloud Spanner logs indicated no evidence of any customer impact. If you were impacted, please contact Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support, and we will review your logs.\n* **Cloud SQL:** Customers experienced downtime on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 starting at 09:25 US/Pacific. 36% of zonal (non-HA) instances in europe-west2-a were affected. Additionally, 31% of regional (HA) instances whose primaries were located in europe-west2-a experienced extended downtime because they were unable to successfully fail over to another zone. Finally, customers experienced some failures during the incident for backup, instance creation, update, delete, restart, export, and Database Migration Service operations. The total impact duration was 17 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:00 US/Pacific\n* **Dataflow:** Approximately 8% of Dataflow streaming jobs running in europe-west2 were stuck from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:11 to 12:38 US/Pacific. There was limited impact to batch Dataflow jobs. Some new Dataflow jobs could not be initiated. The total impact duration was 5 hours, 27 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 12:38 US/Pacific\n* **Datastream:** Datastream streams experienced errors and processing lag in europe-west2-a as a result of impact on the data-plane infrastructure and services from Tuesday, 19 July 2002 09:05 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:00 US/Pacific. Customers were advised to run their streams in another region. The total impact duration was 17 hours, 55 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:00 US/Pacific\n* **Google App Engine, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run:** Customers may have experienced high error rates for Google App Engine, Cloud Functions and Cloud Run in europe-west2. Customers with a multi-region architecture could failover to another region. Traffic for ~72% of projects from Cloud Tasks, Cloud Scheduler, Eventarc, Cloud Pubsub to App Engine and Cloud Functions experienced up to 18% dropped requests/events on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:18 to 10:05 US/Pacific. Traffic from other sources (including end-users) to ~35% of App Engine, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run projects experienced elevated latency in the same time period. Furthermore, ~5% of Cloud Run projects experienced elevated error rates (reaching peaks of 90% unavailability) caused by new instances failing to be created (some of which were due to a dependency on Google Cloud Secret Manager). The total impact duration was: * App Engine Flexible: 13 hours, 1 minute * App Engine Standard: 3 hours, 36 minutes * Cloud Functions: 3 hours, 36 minutes * Cloud Run: 3 hours, 36 minutes ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific (App Engine Standard, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run) and Tuesday, 19 July 2022 20:30 US/Pacific (App Engine Flexible)\n* **Google BigQuery:** On Tuesday, 19 July 2022 between 04:40 US/Pacific and 13:43 US/Pacific, 12% of the projects in europe-west2 experienced errors and dataset unavailability. This was caused by mitigations and the power down of one of the data centers serving the europe-west2-a zone, which reduced the storage and compute capacity available to BigQuery. As a regional service, BigQuery was able to mitigate some of this capacity loss by shifting load to other data centers. However, BigQuery datasets which happened to be hosted solely in that data center were unavailable during the power down. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 13:43 US/Pacific\n* **Google Cloud Tasks:** Cloud Tasks automatically distributes projects across cloud zones within a region. 6% of projects in europe-west2 were loaded in the data center that was powered down on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific, and stopped delivering tasks until 13:24, after which delivery was resumed. No tasks were executed in any newly created queues in the region and in any existing queues in the impacted zone. However, as a regional service, Cloud Task was eventually able to mitigate all of the capacity loss by shifting load to other zones. The total impact duration was 3 hours, 19 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 13:24 US/Pacific\n* **Google Cloud Scheduler:** Cloud Scheduler automatically distributes projects across Cloud zones within a region. 6% of projects in europe-west2 were loaded in the datacenter that was powered down on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific and stopped executing jobs until 13:24, after which execution was resumed. As a regional service, Cloud Scheduler was eventually able to mitigate all of the capacity loss by shifting load to other zones. The total impact duration was 3 hours, 19 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 13:24 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Filestore:** 45% of instances in europe-west2-a experienced service unavailability from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 01:10 US/Pacific. This impact lasted until the mitigation time. At this point customers with working instances experienced no additional issues. 6.4% of impacted instances did not recover automatically and had to be recovered manually, which completed on Wednesday, 20 July 18:32 US/Pacific. The symptoms of these varied from unavailability to degraded availability. Customers were advised to fail over to another region, if possible. The total impact duration was 10 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 01:10 US/Pacific\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine:** 15% of zonal clusters in europe-west2-a and 57% of regional & zonal cluster nodes in europe-west2-a were fully unavailable from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 09:30 to 21:30 US/Pacific. Regional cluster control planes remained available, but overall cluster health may have been impacted by node unavailability. Customers were encouraged to move their workloads to other regions if possible. The approximate impact duration was 12 hours. However, a few clusters experienced lag through the next day due to underlying GCE impact. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:30 US/Pacific\n* **Looker:** Looker instances in europe-west2 were unavailable or experienced degraded performance starting Tuesday, July 19, 2022 09:33 through Wednesday, July 20, 2022 at 05:57 US/Pacific. Once temperatures inside the data center returned to safe levels, the Looker team restored file systems for impacted customers, and all Looker instances were back online on Wednesday, July 20, 2022 at 05:57 US/Pacific. The total impact duration was 20 hours, 24 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 05:57 US/Pacific\n* **Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory:** 28.57% of the Managed Active Directory domains configured in the europe-west2 region were impacted during the incident. Starting July 19, 2022 09:20:00 US/Pacific, the impacted customers had one less domain controller (DC) serving incoming traffic. However, the domains continued to operate with reduced redundancy. Furthermore, periodic backups (12h frequency) were not performed for the impacted domains during the incident window. Subsequent backups were successful. The total impact duration was 12 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:50 US/Pacific\n* **Memorystore for Memcached:** 20.8% of instances in europe-west2 experienced degraded performance and availability issues resulting in a total cache flush. Impact start was Tuesday 19 July at 09:35 US/Pacific.All instances with VMs in europe-west2-a were unavailable or performed with degraded performance for the entire duration of the event. Instances that were only located in europe-west2-a were unavailable. Instances with some VMs in europe-west2-a lost their corresponding memcache availability (storage/access).All affected instances experienced a cache flush. DELETE, and RECREATE operations were unavailable for instances located in europe-west2-a. CREATE operations were not affected. UPDATE was not affected as there were no requests during that time but was theoretically unavailable. The total impact duration was 1 day, 5 hours, 27 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 15:02 US/Pacific\n* **Memorystore for Redis:** ~10% of instances in europe-west2 experienced timeouts with the management API (create, update, delete, etc) from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:24 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 21:19 US/Pacific. Customers whose instances are located in the affected data center in the europe-west2-a zone were unable to access their instances. Additionally, all affected instances experienced a cache flush. In total, ~39% of basic-tier instances in europe-west2-a were affected. The total impact duration was 11 hours, 11 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 21:19 US/Pacific\n* **Vertex AI online prediction:** Vertex AI prediction showed an elevated error rate on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 10:00 to 15:11 US/Pacific for a total impact duration of 5 hours 11 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 15:11 US/Pacific\n* **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Approximately 35% of the VMs in the europe-west2-a zone were unreachable from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:06 US/ Pacific to 20:32 US/ Pacific. This includes all Cloud traffic into and out of 1275 / 3509 VMs in europe-west2-a . Both the control plane and the data plane were impacted. The total impact duration was 10 hours, 26 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 20:32 US/Pacific\n-------------------------",

During the initial phase of the outage, some users experienced intermittent failures while uploading files.\nDuring a recent effort to improve the reliability of the Cloud Support backend service, a configuration change was made to our Global Service Load Balancer (GSLB), which resulted in unavailability of the file upload service. Part of this change included migrating the servers to new addresses; however, the server that handles file attachments was not ready for the migration. The configuration change inadvertently made the file upload service used by the backend service inaccessible, resulting in file uploads failing.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers quickly disabled the file attachment feature while they worked on mitigation efforts. The issue was fully mitigated on Monday, 18 July 2022 at 14:00 US/Pacific, once the GSLB configuration change was rolled back.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We are committed to the following actions to prevent this from happening again:\n- Improve monitoring and alerting to detect file attachment errors.\n- Improve our load balancer emergency change procedures based on known best practices within Google to reduce mitigation time.\n- Improve automation testing to detect invalid configuration changes in staging environments.\n- Improve internal rollout procedure for load balancer changes in order to detect rollouts that have unanticipated impact and prevent them from proceeding.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\n### Service(s) Affected:\n## Google Cloud Console ##\n- 100% of users could not upload files to new or existing support cases.

        "text": "## INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity for lower priority traffic such as batch, streaming and transfer operations from 19:30 US/Pacific on Thursday, 14 July 2022, through 15:02 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July 2022. High-priority user-facing traffic was not affected. This service disruption resulted from an issue encountered during a combination of repair work and a routine network software upgrade rollout. Due to the nature of the disruption and resilience capabilities of Google Cloud products, the impacted regions and individual impact windows varied substantially. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause was identified as an issue with a new control plane configuration rollout, causing low-priority classified traffic capacity reduction in Google’s internal backbone network connecting data centers. Mitigation efforts were slowed by the capacity reduction, and engineering teams required more than their usual time to safely undo the configuration change. During the period of the rollout and subsequent rollback, constrained traffic in certain cloud zones affected the performance of some Cloud services.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nAt approximately 02:00 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July, as an in-progress rollout expanded to more regions, Google engineers observed performance degradation in Cloud Networking due to reduced capacity. The engineering team then started an investigation into the cause. At 03:50 US/Pacific, Google engineers pushed the first mitigation attempt to halt the ongoing rollout. While this effort succeeded in pausing any new actions, those already in progress continued, which further reduced network capacity.\nSubsequently, the engineering team shifted their mitigation efforts toward a global rollback of the problematic configuration. Their first attempt to mitigate using a configuration push was applied at 08:40 US/Pacific, but it was not successfully applied to all nodes, due in part to the reduced network performance. Google engineers worked through alternate mitigations, and by 12:40 US/Pacific, the configuration was updated correctly, and this mitigated the majority of impact.\nBy 15:02 US/Pacific on 15 July 2022, services for all customers had been restored. The Google Cloud Service Health Dashboard was updated to reflect this.\nGoogle is committed to preventing future recurrence, and we are taking the following\nactions:\nDetection:\n* Improve signals to detect significant changes in traffic for upgraded domains in the backbone network.\n* Improve dashboards that help debugging global- and domain-level control failures and configuration status.\nPrevention:\n* Improve the automated handling of disconnected local Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers that will reduce overall impact and mitigation time.\n* Improve the global safety systems that globally halt elective rollouts on Google’s wide area (WAN) networks, when global capacity is reduced.\n* Further isolate production network neighborhoods.\nMitigation:\n* Improve the API to push changes to global and local network controllers during a service disruption.\n* Improve failure domain configuration validation to reject unintended configuration.\n* Improve the feature and testing of emergency tools across different scenarios at regular intervals, and invest in test environments that enable us to do this without impact.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\n**Google Cloud Networking**\n* Google Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity within the Google Cloud regions of us-east1, southamerica-west1, us-central1, and us-central2, starting from Friday 15 July 2022 02:24 US/Pacific. The most severe impact occurred from 03:58 to 12:40.\n* southamerica-west1 experienced reduced capacity between 14:40 and 15:02.\n* southamerica-west1 and southamerica-east1 both experienced egress packet loss between 20% and 30%.\n**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**\n* Between Thursday, 14 July 2022 21:57 US/Pacific and Friday, 15 July 12:40 US/Pacific, GCS customers may have experienced elevated latency, delays, issues importing, exporting or querying data from GCS buckets, and HTTP 500 errors in the Google Cloud regions of us-east1, southamerica-west1, and us-central2, and for buckets located in us-central1, us-east1, and nam4.\n* This disruption affected 0.007% of GCS requests and impacted customers reading/writing data and metadata.\n**Google BigQuery**\n* Customer workloads running in impacted Google Cloud regions and using the BigQuery Storage Read and Write APIs to read from or write to BigQuery may have experienced elevated latency.\n**Note**\n* Additional services may have been impacted by this event but did not meet the thresholds to be included in this report.",

      "text": "INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity for lower priority traffic such as batch, streaming and transfer operations from 19:30 US/Pacific on Thursday, 14 July 2022, through 15:02 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July 2022. High-priority user-facing traffic was not affected. This service disruption resulted from an issue encountered during a combination of repair work and a routine network software upgrade rollout. Due to the nature of the disruption and resilience capabilities of Google Cloud products, the impacted regions and individual impact windows varied substantially. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause was identified as an issue with a new control plane configuration rollout, causing low-priority classified traffic capacity reduction in Google’s internal backbone network connecting data centers. Mitigation efforts were slowed by the capacity reduction, and engineering teams required more than their usual time to safely undo the configuration change. During the period of the rollout and subsequent rollback, constrained traffic in certain cloud zones affected the performance of some Cloud services.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nAt approximately 02:00 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July, as an in-progress rollout expanded to more regions, Google engineers observed performance degradation in Cloud Networking due to reduced capacity. The engineering team then started an investigation into the cause. At 03:50 US/Pacific, Google engineers pushed the first mitigation attempt to halt the ongoing rollout. While this effort succeeded in pausing any new actions, those already in progress continued, which further reduced network capacity.\nSubsequently, the engineering team shifted their mitigation efforts toward a global rollback of the problematic configuration. Their first attempt to mitigate using a configuration push was applied at 08:40 US/Pacific, but it was not successfully applied to all nodes, due in part to the reduced network performance. Google engineers worked through alternate mitigations, and by 12:40 US/Pacific, the configuration was updated correctly, and this mitigated the majority of impact.\nBy 15:02 US/Pacific on 15 July 2022, services for all customers had been restored. The Google Cloud Service Health Dashboard was updated to reflect this.\nGoogle is committed to preventing future recurrence, and we are taking the following\nactions:\nDetection:\n* Improve signals to detect significant changes in traffic for upgraded domains in the backbone network.\n* Improve dashboards that help debugging global- and domain-level control failures and configuration status.\nPrevention:\n* Improve the automated handling of disconnected local Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers that will reduce overall impact and mitigation time. .\n* Improve the global safety systems that globally halt elective rollouts on Google’s wide area (WAN) networks, when global capacity is reduced.\n* Further isolate production network neighborhoods.\nMitigation:\n* Improve the API to push changes to global and local network controllers during a service disruption.\n* Improve failure domain configuration validation to reject unintended configuration.\n* Improve the feature and testing of emergency tools across different scenarios at regular intervals, and invest in test environments that enable us to do this without impact.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\n**Google Cloud Networking**\n* Google Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity within the Google Cloud regions of us-east1, southamerica-west1, us-central1, and us-central2, starting from Friday 15 July 2022 02:24 US/Pacific. The most severe impact occurred from 03:58 to 12:40.\n* southamerica-west1 experienced reduced capacity between 14:40 and 15:02.\n* southamerica-west1 and southamerica-east1 both experienced egress packet loss between 20% and 30%.\n**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**\n* Between Thursday, 14 July 2022 21:57 US/Pacific and Friday, 15 July 12:40 US/Pacific, GCS customers may have experienced elevated latency, delays, issues importing, exporting or querying data from GCS buckets, and HTTP 500 errors in the Google Cloud regions of us-east1, southamerica-west1, and us-central2, and for buckets located in us-central1, us-east1, and nam4.\n* This disruption affected 0.007% of GCS requests and impacted customers reading/writing data and metadata.\n**Google BigQuery**\n* Customer workloads running in impacted Google Cloud regions and using the BigQuery Storage Read and Write APIs to read from or write to BigQuery may have experienced elevated latency.\n**Note**\n* Additional services may have been impacted by this event but did not meet the thresholds to be included in this report.",

The issue was mitigated by performing a file system recovery and restart of related services on the resources hosted by Google Cloud VMware Engine.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Affected Customers may have observed issues with network partitions and accessing workload VMs.\n- Affected Customers may have experienced connectivity issues using vCenter, HCX, NSX Manager, and NSX-T Edge virtual machines.\n**Additional details:**\nGoogle engineers have paused the maintenance upgrade and also all redundant devices have been brought back to operational state. We are also working with the impacted customers to check the state of remaining workload VMs and shall assist in recovery if required.",

The issue was mitigated by performing a file system recovery and restart of related services on the resources hosted by Google Cloud VMware Engine.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Affected Customers may have observed issues with network partitions and accessing workload VMs.\n- Affected Customers may have experienced connectivity issues using vCenter, HCX, NSX Manager, and NSX-T Edge virtual machines.\n**Additional details:**\nGoogle engineers have paused the maintenance upgrade and also all redundant devices have been brought back to operational state. We are also working with the impacted customers to check the state of remaining workload VMs and shall assist in recovery if required.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case https://cloud.google.com/support or help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 16 June 2022 01:11\n**Incident End:** 16 June 2022 02:44\n**Duration:** 1 hour, 33 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n- Google Cloud Networking\n- Cloud Monitoring\n- Cloud NAT\n- Hybrid Connectivity\n- Cloud Run\n- Cloud Interconnect\n- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\n- Gmail\n- Cloud Bigtable\n**Regions/Zones:** Europe and Asia\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced elevated packet loss and latency with Google Cloud Services across Europe and Asia for a duration of 1 hour, 36 minutes. Any service that uses Cloud Networking may have observed impact. We have included available details of service specific impact below; however, this may not be a comprehensive accounting of all downstream networking impact.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to a large reconvergence event on our user facing backbone, which was triggered by a typical fiber cut in North America. The failure resulted in packet loss due to either some MPLS tunnels going down, or due to congestion on remaining tunnels that quickly grew to accommodate demand on next-best paths. Tunnels going down is not expected behavior of MPLS control plane in response to best-path capacity going down when adjacent capacity remains available and is being investigated with highest priority with the hardware vendor. Mitigation of the packet loss required Google engineers to manually intervene on the network control plane. The underlying Cloud Networking impact ended at 02:58, however, some Cloud Services may have taken longer to recover.\nDue to backbone control plane behavior during this event, network forwarding may have been suboptimal for some destinations resulting in higher network latency.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- **Google Cloud Networking** - Public IP traffic connectivity failed from 01:22 to 02:58 US/Pacific.\n- **Cloud Monitoring** - Affected customers observed metric data failing to publish in europe-north1.\n- **Cloud NAT** - Affected customers experienced packet loss on some flows between regions in Europe, South America, and North America.\n- **Hybrid Connectivity** - Affected customers experienced packet loss on some flows between regions in Europe, South America, and North America.\n- **Cloud Run** - Affected customers experienced packet loss in europe-north1.\n- **Cloud Interconnect** - Affected customers experienced packet loss on some flows between regions in Europe, South America, and North America.\n- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** - Affected customers experienced up to 100% packet loss with traffic between Europe and Asia over private and public IP.\n- **Cloud Bigtable** - Affected customers experienced elevated latency with read and write operations in europe-north1.\n- **Gmail** - Affected web client users experienced transient service unavailability.\n**Additional details:**\nFiber cuts on the Google network are quite common with no observable malfunction to the MPLS control plane. This incident surfaces a novel MPLS control plane behavior. We are committed to fully identifying the root cause and addressing it to prevent it with our partners.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n**Summary:**\nOn Tuesday, 14 June 2022, at approximately 06:00 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Networking in us-central1 began experiencing increased delays in applying administrative operations, impacting several downstream services. Customers performing administrative actions on resources in us-central1 experienced delays, connectivity issues, and elevated rates of failure.\nTo our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. We are conducting an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Background:**\nGoogle’s Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) is a collection of software and services that load balances HTTP traffic across customer services. A key component of GCLB is the Google Front End (GFE), which load balances traffic over customer backend instances. GCLB also includes a health checking service to determine whether backends such as customer virtual machines, are responding to traffic as expected, or are unhealthy and should be removed from service.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe health checking service and GFE share a common resource pool. For a period of time, GCLB traffic was directed away from certain clusters, and, independently, during this time, health checking load in these clusters increased significantly.\nThe incident was triggered when Google engineers rerouted traffic to these clusters as part of a standard maintenance activity. This rerouted traffic increased load in those clusters, and this slowed the performance of the health checking service, resulting in an increasing rate of health check failures. This in turn led to a general networking control plane slowdown, as the service struggled to keep up with erroneous and rapid health status changes of load balancer backends. The slowdown in the networking control plane resulted in the impact on administrative operations for other resource types which involve network configuration. Customers may have experienced this as slowness or timeouts in administrative operations for the resource types listed in the Impact section, or delays in new resources (like VM instances) connecting to networks.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nOn Monday, 13 June 2022, at 16:30 US/Pacific, Google engineers rerouted traffic to additional compute resources in the us-central1 region as part of a standard maintenance activity.\nGoogle engineers were alerted to control plane slowness on Tuesday, 14 June 2022, at 09:17 and started an investigation. Initially, Google engineers were unable to determine the severity of the latency, due to insufficient monitoring. After attempts to mitigate by adding resources were unsuccessful, the incident was escalated at 15:50. A cross team effort of Google engineers was launched and at 17:39 mitigated the incident by removing the earlier reroute. This reduced the load on the health check system, and subsequently the networking control plane recovered at 17:43.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- Prevent similar incidents by improving the capacity modeling of our health checking service, and implementing improved resource isolation in our health checking service.\n- Detect similar incidents more rapidly by improving alerting related to the health checking process to notify responsible teams earlier and speed time to mitigate.\n- Add defense in depth: protect the downstream networking control plane from high rates of load balancing health reports, thus avoiding this type of incident in future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn 13 June 16:30 to 14 June 17:43 2022 US/Pacific:\n## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\nAffected customers would have observed latency and up to ~40% elevated errors or timeouts during GKE Private Service Connect cluster operations including creation, deletion, and updates for a subset of clusters in us-central1. ## Google Cloud Load Balancing (GCLB)\nCustomers with resources in us-central1-c and us-central1-f would have observed increased latency or timeouts and connection errors from the Load Balancer service for resources in us-central1. Customers would have seen up to a 4.5% overall error rate, with up to 23% of requests timing out. ## Filestore\nAffected customers would have observed new instance creation failures for ~50% of the outage duration. In addition, existing instances would have been running at reduced capacity as some of their nodes may have been incorrectly marked down. ## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nIncreased latency and timeouts for creating and updating networking resources in us-central1.",

This reduced the load on the health check system, and subsequently the networking control plane recovered at 17:43.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- Prevent similar incidents by improving the capacity modeling of our health checking service, and implementing improved resource isolation in our health checking service.\n- Detect similar incidents more rapidly by improving alerting related to the health checking process to notify responsible teams earlier and speed time to mitigate.\n- Add defense in depth: protect the downstream networking control plane from high rates of load balancing health reports, thus avoiding this type of incident in future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn 13 June 16:30 to 14 June 17:43 2022 US/Pacific:\n## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\nAffected customers would have observed latency and up to ~40% elevated errors or timeouts during GKE Private Service Connect cluster operations including creation, deletion, and updates for a subset of clusters in us-central1. ## Google Cloud Load Balancing (GCLB)\nCustomers with resources in us-central1-c and us-central1-f would have observed increased latency or timeouts and connection errors from the Load Balancer service for resources in us-central1. Customers would have seen up to a 4.5% overall error rate, with up to 23% of requests timing out. ## Filestore\nAffected customers would have observed new instance creation failures for ~50% of the outage duration. In addition, existing instances would have been running at reduced capacity as some of their nodes may have been incorrectly marked down. ## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nIncreased latency and timeouts for creating and updating networking resources in us-central1.",

        "text": "**SUMMARY:**\nOn Tuesday, 14 June 2022, customers were unable to create or edit Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances via the Google Cloud Console for 2 days, 8 hours, 27 minutes. To our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. We are conducting an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nCustomers can specify organization policies to limit what instances can use external IP addresses (compute.vmExternalIpAccess). Setting an IP address on an instance not allowed by policy will cause an operation failure.\nThe incident was triggered by a compute frontend UI release which made it impossible for certain users to modify instances due to interactions between org policies and a bug that forced an Ephemeral IP address while on either the edit or create page. Any user with the compute.vmExternalIpAccess policy could not create or edit instances without a public IP.\nA bug was identified where customers with a policy restricting external IP addresses were not able to select one during instance creation. An attempt to fix this bug created a regression where changing any field in the Edit instance page would change the IP address to ephemeral for instances that had no IP address selected. Because of the org policy blocks assigning the instance a public IP, the save operation would fail.The release containing this change included a fix to address the bug however, once in production several customers reported issues.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via customer support case on Thursday, 16 June 2022 at 04:15 and started an investigation. At 06:11, Google engineers were able to reproduce the issue and escalated the incident at 09:08. At 09:50, Google engineers initiated a bug of the release which was completed at 11:33 fully mitigating the issue.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- Improve unit testing for org policies to identify issues of this type.\n- Improve alerting to quickly detect configuration failures.\n**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT:**\nOn Tuesday, 14 June 2022 03:06 to Thursday 16 June 11:33 US/Pacific\n# Google Compute Engine\nAffected customers experienced failures creating or editing GCE instances via the Google Cloud Console and may have received an error “Constraint constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess violated for project [project ID].“\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR CUSTOMERS:**\nAs a workaround, customers were still able to create or edit GCE instances via the gcloud CLI or via Google Cloud Console by disabling the constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess policy.",

      "text": "**SUMMARY:**\nOn Tuesday, 14 June 2022, customers were unable to create or edit Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances via the Google Cloud Console for 2 days, 8 hours, 27 minutes. To our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. We are conducting an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nCustomers can specify organization policies to limit what instances can use external IP addresses (compute.vmExternalIpAccess). Setting an IP address on an instance not allowed by policy will cause an operation failure.\nThe incident was triggered by a compute frontend UI release which made it impossible for certain users to modify instances due to interactions between org policies and a bug that forced an Ephemeral IP address while on either the edit or create page. Any user with the compute.vmExternalIpAccess policy could not create or edit instances without a public IP.\nA bug was identified where customers with a policy restricting external IP addresses were not able to select one during instance creation. An attempt to fix this bug created a regression where changing any field in the Edit instance page would change the IP address to ephemeral for instances that had no IP address selected. Because of the org policy blocks assigning the instance a public IP, the save operation would fail.The release containing this change included a fix to address the bug however, once in production several customers reported issues.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via customer support case on Thursday, 16 June 2022 at 04:15 and started an investigation. At 06:11, Google engineers were able to reproduce the issue and escalated the incident at 09:08. At 09:50, Google engineers initiated a bug of the release which was completed at 11:33 fully mitigating the issue.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- Improve unit testing for org policies to identify issues of this type.\n- Improve alerting to quickly detect configuration failures.\n**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT:**\nOn Tuesday, 14 June 2022 03:06 to Thursday 16 June 11:33 US/Pacific\n# Google Compute Engine\nAffected customers experienced failures creating or editing GCE instances via the Google Cloud Console and may have received an error “Constraint constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess violated for project [project ID].“\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR CUSTOMERS:**\nAs a workaround, customers were still able to create or edit GCE instances via the gcloud CLI or via Google Cloud Console by disabling the constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess policy.",

        "text": "# INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nOn Tuesday, 7 June 2022, Google Cloud Networking experienced increased packet loss for egress traffic from Google to users and customers in the Middle East and elevated latency between our Europe and Asia Regions for 3 hours and 12 minutes, affecting several Cloud Networking products.\nTo our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. We are conducting an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe outage was triggered by two simultaneous fiber cuts within our Middle East network. This affected the end-to-end path for several submarine cables, reducing capacity for many telecom and technology companies, including Google.\nThe reduced capacity increased latency and caused packet loss between Google regions in Europe and regions in the Middle East and the rest of Asia.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle Engineers were alerted to the network bandwidth drop on Tuesday, 7 June 2022 at 06:00 US/Pacific. Google Engineers immediately started to redirect Internet egress demand away from the region. At 07:02, Europe-Asia traffic was redirected across backup circuits via America, trading increased latency for lower packet loss. Fiber engineers restored interim capacity by 08:26, ending packet loss between Europe and the Middle East. Once final stability was confirmed, Europe-Asia traffic was moved back to the direct path at 09:02.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- We are increasing the resilience of terrestrial network paths to provide more resilience to dual failures.\n- We are continuing with our planned programme of additional investments in the Europe-Middle East network to offer alternative network paths.\n- We are improving the effectiveness of tooling to reduce Internet egress demand during capacity shortfalls.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn 07 June 2022 05:50 from 05:50 to 09:03 US/Pacific: ## Cloud Load Balancing\nCustomers using Cloud Load Balancing would have experienced increased packet loss up to 60% for egress traffic from Google to the Middle East and increased network latency between our Europe and Asia regions. ## Cloud Interconnect\nCloud Interconnect customers peering in the Middle East region would have experienced packet loss up to 80% during the incident. ## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nCustomers using Virtual Private Cloud requiring cross-regional traffic between the following regions would have experienced packet loss of up to 50% between 05:47 and 07:03, then elevated network latency until 09:03:\n- asia-east1 to europe-southwest1, europe-west6, and europe-west8;\n- asia-east2 to all regions in Europe;\n- asia-south1 and asia-south2 to all regions in Europe, all northamerica-northeast and northamerica-southeast, and all us-east regions;\n- asia-southeast1 and asia-southeast2 to all regions in Europe;\n- australia-southeast2 to europe-west8.\n## Other Services\nWhile not specifically called out, all Google Cloud Services in the Middle East and our Europe and Asia regions could have been affected by the packet loss for egress traffic from Google to the Middle East, as well as increased latency between our Europe and Asia regions. We have listed the major services that our telemetry identified as causing customer impact.",

      "text": "# INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nOn Tuesday, 7 June 2022, Google Cloud Networking experienced increased packet loss for egress traffic from Google to users and customers in the Middle East and elevated latency between our Europe and Asia Regions for 3 hours and 12 minutes, affecting several Cloud Networking products.\nTo our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. We are conducting an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe outage was triggered by two simultaneous fiber cuts within our Middle East network. This affected the end-to-end path for several submarine cables, reducing capacity for many telecom and technology companies, including Google.\nThe reduced capacity increased latency and caused packet loss between Google regions in Europe and regions in the Middle East and the rest of Asia.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle Engineers were alerted to the network bandwidth drop on Tuesday, 7 June 2022 at 06:00 US/Pacific. Google Engineers immediately started to redirect Internet egress demand away from the region. At 07:02, Europe-Asia traffic was redirected across backup circuits via America, trading increased latency for lower packet loss. Fiber engineers restored interim capacity by 08:26, ending packet loss between Europe and the Middle East. Once final stability was confirmed, Europe-Asia traffic was moved back to the direct path at 09:02.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- We are increasing the resilience of terrestrial network paths to provide more resilience to dual failures.\n- We are continuing with our planned programme of additional investments in the Europe-Middle East network to offer alternative network paths.\n- We are improving the effectiveness of tooling to reduce Internet egress demand during capacity shortfalls.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn 07 June 2022 05:50 from 05:50 to 09:03 US/Pacific: ## Cloud Load Balancing\nCustomers using Cloud Load Balancing would have experienced increased packet loss up to 60% for egress traffic from Google to the Middle East and increased network latency between our Europe and Asia regions. ## Cloud Interconnect\nCloud Interconnect customers peering in the Middle East region would have experienced packet loss up to 80% during the incident. ## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nCustomers using Virtual Private Cloud requiring cross-regional traffic between the following regions would have experienced packet loss of up to 50% between 05:47 and 07:03, then elevated network latency until 09:03:\n- asia-east1 to europe-southwest1, europe-west6, and europe-west8;\n- asia-east2 to all regions in Europe;\n- asia-south1 and asia-south2 to all regions in Europe, all northamerica-northeast and northamerica-southeast, and all us-east regions;\n- asia-southeast1 and asia-southeast2 to all regions in Europe;\n- australia-southeast2 to europe-west8.\n## Other Services\nWhile not specifically called out, all Google Cloud Services in the Middle East and our Europe and Asia regions could have been affected by the packet loss for egress traffic from Google to the Middle East, as well as increased latency between our Europe and Asia regions. We have listed the major services that our telemetry identified as causing customer impact.",

The issues were triggered by high memory consumption on the file storage system in the Google Cloud distributed storage infrastructure [1] within us-east1-c. These issues were predominantly isolated to us-east1-c for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic was redirected away from the impacted zone.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system\n**Customer Impact:**\n- **BigQuery :** Customers would have experienced failures or slowness in their requests in the us-east1 region.\n- **Cloud Dataflow:** Customers would have experienced slow or stuck jobs in us-east1.\n- **App Engine:** Customers would have experienced brief periods of unavailability.\n- **Cloud Tasks:** Customers would have experienced elevated latencies with task delivery in us-east1.\n- **Cloud Pub/Sub:** Customers would have experienced elevated error rate for Pub/Sub operations in us-east1.\n- **Persistent Disk:** Customers would have experienced slow or stuck disk reads in the us-east1-c zone leading to unresponsive instances. A small number of Regional Persistent Disk volumes experienced slow disk reads in the us-east1 region.\n- **Cloud Bigtable:** Customers would have experienced elevated latency or errors in the us-east1-c zone.\n- **Cloud Run:** A small number of customers in us-east1 would have experienced brief periods of unavailability.\n- **Google Compute Engine:** Customers would have experienced elevated latencies during instance creation or deletion operations in us-east1 and us-east4.\n- **Google Cloud Networking:** Customers would have experienced delays in connecting to newly created instances or delays in propagation of new changes to firewall programming in us-east1. Network traffic for existing instances was not affected. Customers would have also experienced delays in Cloud Load Balancing creation or modification.\n- **Cloud Functions:** Customers would have experienced elevated availability issues in us-east1.\n- **Cloud Composer:** Customers would have experienced failure with new cloud composer creations in us-east1 and us-east4 . Existing cloud composer environments were not affected.\n- **Cloud Datastore:** Customers would have experienced elevated query latencies in us-east1.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case at https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 04 June 2022 10:47\n**Incident End:** 04 June 2022 17:03\n**Duration:** 6 hours 16 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nMultiple Google Cloud Services\n**Regions/Zones:** us-east1-c\n**Description:**\nDue to elevated latencies, several Google Cloud Products experienced increased error rates for a period of 3 hrs 04 minutes. The issues were triggered by high memory consumption on the file storage system in the Google Cloud distributed storage infrastructure [1] within us-east1-c. These issues were predominantly isolated to us-east1-c for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic was redirected away from the impacted zone.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system\n**Customer Impact:**\n- **BigQuery :** Customers would have experienced failures or slowness in their requests in the us-east1 region.\n- **Cloud Dataflow:** Customers would have experienced slow or stuck jobs in us-east1.\n- **App Engine:** Customers would have experienced brief periods of unavailability.\n- **Cloud Tasks:** Customers would have experienced elevated latencies with task delivery in us-east1.\n- **Cloud Pub/Sub:** Customers would have experienced elevated error rate for Pub/Sub operations in us-east1.\n- **Persistent Disk:** Customers would have experienced slow or stuck disk reads in the us-east1-c zone leading to unresponsive instances. A small number of Regional Persistent Disk volumes experienced slow disk reads in the us-east1 region.\n- **Cloud Bigtable:** Customers would have experienced elevated latency or errors in the us-east1-c zone.\n- **Cloud Run:** A small number of customers in us-east1 would have experienced brief periods of unavailability.\n- **Google Compute Engine:** Customers would have experienced elevated latencies during instance creation or deletion operations in us-east1 and us-east4.\n- **Google Cloud Networking:** Customers would have experienced delays in connecting to newly created instances or delays in propagation of new changes to firewall programming in us-east1. Network traffic for existing instances was not affected. Customers would have also experienced delays in Cloud Load Balancing creation or modification.\n- **Cloud Functions:** Customers would have experienced elevated availability issues in us-east1.\n- **Cloud Composer:** Customers would have experienced failure with new cloud composer creations in us-east1 and us-east4 . Existing cloud composer environments were not affected.\n- **Cloud Datastore:** Customers would have experienced elevated query latencies in us-east1.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case https://cloud.google.com/support or help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 02 June 2022 10:10 US/Pacific\n**Incident End:** 02 June 2022 14:30 US/Pacific\n**Duration:** 4 hours, 20 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:** Vertex AI Online Prediction\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nVertex AI Online Prediction experienced increased error rates from 30% up to 100% per region depending on user usage patterns for a duration of 4 hours, 20 minutes. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was that Vertex Prediction Endpoints were globally marked as deleted due to faulty resource cleanup process. The service fully recovered when the Vertex Prediction Endpoints were restored.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected customers may have experienced:\n- All pre-existing Vertex models undeployed on Vertex AI Endpoints\n- Empty responses when listing the deployed models\n- Runtime exceptions and general errors on Predict and Explain requests\n- Quota failure when trying to re-deploy models",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was that Vertex Prediction Endpoints were globally marked as deleted due to faulty resource cleanup process. The service fully recovered when the Vertex Prediction Endpoints were restored.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected customers may have experienced:\n- All pre-existing Vertex models undeployed on Vertex AI Endpoints\n- Empty responses when listing the deployed models\n- Runtime exceptions and general errors on Predict and Explain requests\n- Quota failure when trying to re-deploy models",

        "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 24 May 2022 from 18:04 to 25 May 2022 10:34 Google BigQuery experienced elevated query latencies and job failures in four regions (US multiregion, europe-west1, asia-east1, and asia-east2) for a duration of 16 hours, 30 minutes. A product change roll out was identified as the root cause. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the changes. The rollback was performed in phases to prevent additional impact on the service, which caused some regions to recover earlier than others. Affected customers experienced elevated latencies or failures for QUERY, IMPORT and EXPORT jobs in BigQuery.\n**Root Cause:**\nOn 11 May 2022, BigQuery began a software rollout to improve audit logging for data that is imported from, queried, or exported to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This rollout inadvertently contained a memory leak that gradually and incrementally manifested whenever these code paths were executed. This memory leak gradually consumed memory on BigQuery’s compute nodes until they were unable to accept new work to execute jobs, including queries, loads, and exports. The software rollout was deployed to all regions before the issue was detected and rolled back. Given the nature of the root cause, significant user load and time were required for the issue to manifest, meaning that the issue was not observed in internal testing, or in most of BigQuery's production regions.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nBigQuery will take the following actions to mitigate against such issues happening in the future: - In the short-term, enable comprehensive memory error detector coverage for the affected code path to detect possible memory leaks ahead of time. - In the long-term, ensure such analysis is enabled for all BigQuery code paths.\nIntroduce additional internal monitoring to detect memory pressure scenarios.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nIn affected regions, a portion of BigQuery compute nodes were unable to service incoming jobs due to insufficient memory. As a result customer jobs - including queries, loads, and exports - experienced elevated latencies and failures while waiting for nodes with sufficient memory to become available.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a product change which had been rolled out globally. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the changes. The rollback was performed in a phased manner to prevent additional impact on the service and some regions would have recovered earlier than others.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Affected customers would have experienced elevated query latencies or in some cases query failures.",

      "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 24 May 2022 from 18:04 to 25 May 2022 10:34 Google BigQuery experienced elevated query latencies and job failures in four regions (US multiregion, europe-west1, asia-east1, and asia-east2) for a duration of 16 hours, 30 minutes. A product change roll out was identified as the root cause. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the changes. The rollback was performed in phases to prevent additional impact on the service, which caused some regions to recover earlier than others. Affected customers experienced elevated latencies or failures for QUERY, IMPORT and EXPORT jobs in BigQuery.\n**Root Cause:**\nOn 11 May 2022, BigQuery began a software rollout to improve audit logging for data that is imported from, queried, or exported to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This rollout inadvertently contained a memory leak that gradually and incrementally manifested whenever these code paths were executed. This memory leak gradually consumed memory on BigQuery’s compute nodes until they were unable to accept new work to execute jobs, including queries, loads, and exports. The software rollout was deployed to all regions before the issue was detected and rolled back. Given the nature of the root cause, significant user load and time were required for the issue to manifest, meaning that the issue was not observed in internal testing, or in most of BigQuery's production regions.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nBigQuery will take the following actions to mitigate against such issues happening in the future: - In the short-term, enable comprehensive memory error detector coverage for the affected code path to detect possible memory leaks ahead of time. - In the long-term, ensure such analysis is enabled for all BigQuery code paths.\nIntroduce additional internal monitoring to detect memory pressure scenarios.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nIn affected regions, a portion of BigQuery compute nodes were unable to service incoming jobs due to insufficient memory. As a result customer jobs - including queries, loads, and exports - experienced elevated latencies and failures while waiting for nodes with sufficient memory to become available.",

The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 14:07 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA failure of a component on a fiber path from one of the central US gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss while the backbone automatically moved traffic onto remaining paths.\nThe network topology in this region is being augmented, and the second-best path has not completed its augmentation. This meant some traffic needed to reroute onto the third-best path, which led to an extended traffic migration period. This disruption was more severe than we had anticipated, and is the subject of remediation actions below.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 13:47 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 14:06 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this event affected our customers.\nWe have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve are ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nIn this network region, we intend to complete the augmentation by 11 July 2022, which will return the network to the intended topology where any single fiber path failure can be rerouted quickly onto the second-best path.\nWe will also build automatic analysis to ensure that the network topology during augmentation always supports fast convergence.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT:**\n- Google Cloud Networking - Affected customers would have observed packet loss for ingress and egress traffic to and from US Central Cloud regions from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud VPN - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors for cross region VPN with global routing from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific. Intra-region traffic for Classic and HA VPN would not have been affected.\n- Cloud Router - Affected customers would have observed delays in global routing propagation from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud Interconnect - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Google Cloud Storage - Affected customers would have experienced elevated latency, HTTP 500 errors, or transient API errors from 13:47 to 14:17 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud SQL - Affected customers would have experienced failures for Export, Update, and Delete operations as well as delayed data replication in us-west1 from 13:53 to 14:13 US/Pacific.\n- Messages - Affected customers would have experienced service availability issues from 13:49 to 14:05 US/Pacific.",

      "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**SUMMARY:**\nOn Friday, 20 May 2022 at 13:47 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Networking experienced intermittent packet loss for traffic between multiple cloud regions for a duration of 20 minutes. The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 14:07 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA failure of a component on a fiber path from one of the central US gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss while the backbone automatically moved traffic onto remaining paths.\nThe network topology in this region is being augmented, and the second-best path has not completed its augmentation. This meant some traffic needed to reroute onto the third-best path, which led to an extended traffic migration period. This disruption was more severe than we had anticipated, and is the subject of remediation actions below.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 13:47 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 14:06 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this event affected our customers.\nWe have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve are ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nIn this network region, we intend to complete the augmentation by 11 July 2022, which will return the network to the intended topology where any single fiber path failure can be rerouted quickly onto the second-best path.\nWe will also build automatic analysis to ensure that the network topology during augmentation always supports fast convergence.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT:**\n- Google Cloud Networking - Affected customers would have observed packet loss for ingress and egress traffic to and from US Central Cloud regions from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud VPN - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors for cross region VPN with global routing from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific. Intra-region traffic for Classic and HA VPN would not have been affected.\n- Cloud Router - Affected customers would have observed delays in global routing propagation from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud Interconnect - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Google Cloud Storage - Affected customers would have experienced elevated latency, HTTP 500 errors, or transient API errors from 13:47 to 14:17 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud SQL - Affected customers would have experienced failures for Export, Update, and Delete operations as well as delayed data replication in us-west1 from 13:53 to 14:13 US/Pacific.\n- Messages - Affected customers would have experienced service availability issues from 13:49 to 14:05 US/Pacific.",

        "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 6 May 2022 at 01:30 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced issues in the us-central1 region. These issues mostly were isolated to us-central1-b for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic could be shifted away from the impacted zone. Most Google Cloud services recovered automatically, after the underlying problem was resolved.\nWe sincerely apologize for the impact to your service or application. We completed an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve the quality and reliability of our services. If you believe that your services experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please [contact us](https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla).\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle Cloud systems are built on a zonal distributed storage system called [Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system), which replicates data across a large number of individual storage servers called D Servers. In this incident, a background job responsible for repacking storage objects began to retry those repack operations more aggressively as part of its normal operations. This subsequently increased the load on the Colossus system in the zone, including the number of open connections to the D Servers.\nThe sudden increase in connection load to D Servers caused a small number of servers to unexpectedly crash due to high memory pressure. This led our automated management systems to remove them from the serving fleet for Colossus. This further reduced the number of D Servers available to handle the rising traffic loads and increased the traffic latency within the Colossus system in the impacted zone.\nThis significant increase in latency subsequently impacted our customers’ performance across a range of Google Cloud services that are built atop Colossus, including Persistent Disk, BigQuery, and many others.\nThis zonal incident impacted some regional services due to the specific failure mode. When a Colossus cluster is marked down, the regional services receive proactive notification and automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Since this cluster was still up, but with variable latency for some operations, the regional services received no proactive notification and were unable to automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Therefore, the impact to a number of regional services was extended as they had to manually remove the impacted cluster from serving.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on Friday, 6 May, 2022 at 01:54 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineers stopped the background traffic. To increase traffic capacity, Google engineers re-added the impacted D Servers to the serving fleet, mitigating the issue at 12:06 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We are taking the following steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n* Investigate and add additional protections in the D Servers to decrease memory pressure during high network traffic load periods.\n* Improve the retry logic for the storage object repacking job to ensure that it cannot overload the Colossus system within a zone.\n* Extend the automated D Server management systems to better handle crash loop conditions and quickly restore D Servers to production once they become healthy.\n* Google's regional services are designed to tolerate zonal failure while staying within their service level objectives. The nature of this failure was not properly handled by some regional services. We are committed to investigating the behavior of each regional service impacted in this outage to ensure that fault tolerance gaps are properly addressed.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nSome customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted region.\n* **BigQuery [us-central1 and US multi-region]:** Customers saw increased query, import, and export latencies and errors. The overall duration of impact was 6 hours 5 minutes in us-central1 and 4 hours 34 minutes in US multi-region.\n* **Cloud Bigtable [us-central1-b zone]:** A small number of Customers in us-central1-b experienced elevated latency and errors as well as replication delays for a duration of 10 hours, 36 minutes. A very minor percentage of the affected customers for Cloud Bigtable had residual impact for additional 6 hours, 40 minutes.\n* **Cloud Pub/Sub [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen missing backlog stats metrics for subscriptions against topics with messages published to us-central1 for a duration of 2 hours, 41 minutes. Since the impact was based on the message publish region, the subscribers could have been in regions other than us-central1.\n* **Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) [us-central1-b zone]:** New load balancer creations and modifications or deletions of existing components with backends in us-central1-b may have been delayed or not taken effect until the outage was resolved. The total impact duration for GCLB is 4 hours, 46 minutes.\n* **Google Compute Engine (GCE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have seen issues with instance availability in us-central1-b due to some input/output (I/O) operations in Persistent Disk Standard disks being stuck for over one minute. Additionally, Regional Persistent Disk Standard disks with a replica in us-central1-b may have been briefly affected due to delays in failover. A small number of instances may have experienced brief loss of network connectivity to other Google Cloud services following live migration events. The total impact duration for GCE is around 5 hours, 25 minutes.\n* **Cloud Datastream [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen streams enter into \"Failed\" state on the Datastream UI, noticed no new data ingested by Datastream into Google Cloud Storage buckets, had duplicate data loaded into Google Cloud Storage, or metrics not being reported. This impacted a whole region for a duration of 7 hours 40 minutes, because the cluster over provisioning was not at a high enough level, and losing one zone on the underlying Kafka cluster caused the cluster to be at 100% utilization, until it was able to fully copy the data to a new zone.\n* **Cloud Filestore [us-central1-b zone]:** Many Filestore instance creation operations failed. Additionally, a small number of instances were unresponsive for the duration of the incident. Some instances suffered performance impact.\n* **Cloud Memorystore [us-central1-b zone]:** Redis nodes in us-central1-b may have been unavailable for a duration of 3 hours, 54 minutes.\n* **Cloud SQL [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may not have been able to connect to their instance in us-central1-b through the Cloud SQL Auth proxy for a duration of 3 hours, 5 minutes.\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have experienced issues interacting with their clusters' control planes. New workloads may not have been scheduled. Auto scaling may not have been operational.The total impact duration for GKE is 7 hours, 11 minutes.\n* **Apigee [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen errors for their API traffic with Datastore Errors. Apigee is internally redundant across zones within the region, but due to the high latency failure mode in us-central1-b, the engineers were not able to remove the impacted zone from the regional cluster. The total impact duration for Apigee is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Dataflow [us-central1 region]:** New Dataflow jobs may have failed to start in us-central1-b. Jobs already running in us-central1-b may have been stuck or delayed, but restarting the jobs would have automatically routed them to a healthy zone starting at 05:00 US/Pacific if the customer was using auto zone placement. The total impact duration for dataflow is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Cloud Data Fusion (CDF) [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have experienced DataFusion instance creation failures, instance availability issues and higher data processing pipeline failures. This was because Persistent Disk (PD) issues caused DataFusion backend services to become unhealthy and the total impact duration was about 7 hours.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case using https://cloud.google.com/support or help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 06 May 2022 01:30\n**Incident End:** 06 May 2022 12:06\n**Duration:** 10 hours, 36 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:** * BigQuery * Cloud Pub/Sub * Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) * Google Compute Engine (GCE) * Datastream * Cloud Filestore * Cloud Memorystore * Cloud SQL * Apigee * Cloud Dataflow * Cloud Data Fusion (CDF) * Cloud Bigtable * Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\n**Regions/Zones:** us-central1-b\n**Description:**\nMultiple Google Cloud services experienced issues in the us-central1 region beginning Friday, 6 May 2022 at 01:30 PT. These issues were predominantly isolated to us-central1-b for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic could be shifted away from the impacted zone. Most services recovered automatically after the underlying problem was resolved.\nThe issues were triggered by an unexpected increase in normally occurring background traffic in the Google Cloud distributed storage infrastructure[1] within the us-central1-b zone. The system automatically directed load away from backend file servers that were impacted by this load increase. This subsequently reduced the overall traffic capacity in the zone. Google engineers mitigated the issue by stopping the background traffic and marking the impacted file servers as available in order to increase capacity.\n**Customer Impact:**\n**How Customers Experienced the Issue:** Some customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted region.\n* **BigQuery:** Customers may have seen increased query delays and/or failures.\n* **Cloud Bigtable:** Customers may have experienced elevated latency and errors.\n* **Cloud Pub/Sub:** Customers may have seen missing metrics for backlog statistics.\n* **Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB):** New load balancer creations, as well as modifications or deletions of existing components, with backends in us-central1-b may have been delayed or not taken effect until the outage was resolved.\n* **Google Compute Engine (GCE):** Customers may have seen issues with instance availability in us-central1-b due to some input/output (I/O) operations in Persistent Disk being stuck for over one minute. A small number of instances may have experienced brief loss of network reachability to other Google Cloud services following live migration events.\n* **Datastream:** Customers may have seen streams enter into \"Failed\" state on the Datastream UI, noticed no new data ingested by Datastream into Google Cloud Storage bucket, or metrics not being reported.\n* **Cloud Filestore:** Customers may have experienced hung tasks in Filestore instances.\n* **Cloud Memorystore:** Redis nodes in us-central1-b may have been unavailable.\n* **Cloud SQL:** Customers may not have been able to connect to their instance in us-central1-b through the proxy-server.\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** Customers may have experienced issues interacting with the control plane. New workloads may not have been scheduled. Auto scaling may not have been operational.\n* **Apigee:** Customers may have seen errors for their API traffic with Datastore Errors.\n* **Dataflow:** Some Dataflow batch and streaming jobs in us-central1 may have been stuck or delayed.\n* **Cloud Data Fusion (CDF):** CDF operations, like instance creation and pipeline launch, may have failed in the us-central1 region due to an issue on Compute Engine.\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system",

      "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 6 May 2022 at 01:30 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced issues in the us-central1 region. These issues mostly were isolated to us-central1-b for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic could be shifted away from the impacted zone. Most Google Cloud services recovered automatically, after the underlying problem was resolved.\nWe sincerely apologize for the impact to your service or application. We completed an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve the quality and reliability of our services. If you believe that your services experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please [contact us](https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla).\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle Cloud systems are built on a zonal distributed storage system called [Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system), which replicates data across a large number of individual storage servers called D Servers. In this incident, a background job responsible for repacking storage objects began to retry those repack operations more aggressively as part of its normal operations. This subsequently increased the load on the Colossus system in the zone, including the number of open connections to the D Servers.\nThe sudden increase in connection load to D Servers caused a small number of servers to unexpectedly crash due to high memory pressure. This led our automated management systems to remove them from the serving fleet for Colossus. This further reduced the number of D Servers available to handle the rising traffic loads and increased the traffic latency within the Colossus system in the impacted zone.\nThis significant increase in latency subsequently impacted our customers’ performance across a range of Google Cloud services that are built atop Colossus, including Persistent Disk, BigQuery, and many others.\nThis zonal incident impacted some regional services due to the specific failure mode. When a Colossus cluster is marked down, the regional services receive proactive notification and automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Since this cluster was still up, but with variable latency for some operations, the regional services received no proactive notification and were unable to automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Therefore, the impact to a number of regional services was extended as they had to manually remove the impacted cluster from serving.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on Friday, 6 May, 2022 at 01:54 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineers stopped the background traffic. To increase traffic capacity, Google engineers re-added the impacted D Servers to the serving fleet, mitigating the issue at 12:06 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We are taking the following steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n* Investigate and add additional protections in the D Servers to decrease memory pressure during high network traffic load periods.\n* Improve the retry logic for the storage object repacking job to ensure that it cannot overload the Colossus system within a zone.\n* Extend the automated D Server management systems to better handle crash loop conditions and quickly restore D Servers to production once they become healthy.\n* Google's regional services are designed to tolerate zonal failure while staying within their service level objectives. The nature of this failure was not properly handled by some regional services. We are committed to investigating the behavior of each regional service impacted in this outage to ensure that fault tolerance gaps are properly addressed.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nSome customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted region.\n* **BigQuery [us-central1 and US multi-region]:** Customers saw increased query, import, and export latencies and errors. The overall duration of impact was 6 hours 5 minutes in us-central1 and 4 hours 34 minutes in US multi-region.\n* **Cloud Bigtable [us-central1-b zone]:** A small number of Customers in us-central1-b experienced elevated latency and errors as well as replication delays for a duration of 10 hours, 36 minutes. A very minor percentage of the affected customers for Cloud Bigtable had residual impact for additional 6 hours, 40 minutes.\n* **Cloud Pub/Sub [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen missing backlog stats metrics for subscriptions against topics with messages published to us-central1 for a duration of 2 hours, 41 minutes. Since the impact was based on the message publish region, the subscribers could have been in regions other than us-central1.\n* **Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) [us-central1-b zone]:** New load balancer creations and modifications or deletions of existing components with backends in us-central1-b may have been delayed or not taken effect until the outage was resolved. The total impact duration for GCLB is 4 hours, 46 minutes.\n* **Google Compute Engine (GCE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have seen issues with instance availability in us-central1-b due to some input/output (I/O) operations in Persistent Disk Standard disks being stuck for over one minute. Additionally, Regional Persistent Disk Standard disks with a replica in us-central1-b may have been briefly affected due to delays in failover. A small number of instances may have experienced brief loss of network connectivity to other Google Cloud services following live migration events. The total impact duration for GCE is around 5 hours, 25 minutes.\n* **Cloud Datastream [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen streams enter into \"Failed\" state on the Datastream UI, noticed no new data ingested by Datastream into Google Cloud Storage buckets, had duplicate data loaded into Google Cloud Storage, or metrics not being reported. This impacted a whole region for a duration of 7 hours 40 minutes, because the cluster over provisioning was not at a high enough level, and losing one zone on the underlying Kafka cluster caused the cluster to be at 100% utilization, until it was able to fully copy the data to a new zone.\n* **Cloud Filestore [us-central1-b zone]:** Many Filestore instance creation operations failed. Additionally, a small number of instances were unresponsive for the duration of the incident. Some instances suffered performance impact.\n* **Cloud Memorystore [us-central1-b zone]:** Redis nodes in us-central1-b may have been unavailable for a duration of 3 hours, 54 minutes.\n* **Cloud SQL [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may not have been able to connect to their instance in us-central1-b through the Cloud SQL Auth proxy for a duration of 3 hours, 5 minutes.\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have experienced issues interacting with their clusters' control planes. New workloads may not have been scheduled. Auto scaling may not have been operational.The total impact duration for GKE is 7 hours, 11 minutes.\n* **Apigee [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen errors for their API traffic with Datastore Errors. Apigee is internally redundant across zones within the region, but due to the high latency failure mode in us-central1-b, the engineers were not able to remove the impacted zone from the regional cluster. The total impact duration for Apigee is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Dataflow [us-central1 region]:** New Dataflow jobs may have failed to start in us-central1-b. Jobs already running in us-central1-b may have been stuck or delayed, but restarting the jobs would have automatically routed them to a healthy zone starting at 05:00 US/Pacific if the customer was using auto zone placement. The total impact duration for dataflow is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Cloud Data Fusion (CDF) [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have experienced DataFusion instance creation failures, instance availability issues and higher data processing pipeline failures. This was because Persistent Disk (PD) issues caused DataFusion backend services to become unhealthy and the total impact duration was about 7 hours.",

Additionally, customers were unable to create, view, or search support cases in the Google Cloud Support Center and Google Admin Console for 1 hour and 24 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the impact to your service or application. We have completed an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve our service’s quality and reliability.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe Serverless stack relies on a file serving service for container images. The issue was triggered when the file serving component of the Serverless stack experienced a sudden increase in traffic. A bug, introduced in a recent configuration change to the file serving service, was surfaced by the sudden increase in traffic, causing many threads to get stuck. This led to resource exhaustion on the affected file servers, causing some tasks to crash and preventing new requests from completing.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on Thursday, 28 April 2022, at 07:11 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the affected component was identified, engineers added additional capacity to the component in the zone that was experiencing the degradation. This mitigated the resource exhaustion, and the service recovered at 08:20 US/Pacific.\nTo prevent recurrence of the issue, engineers rolled back the configuration change to the previous stable version and implemented an automated release block to prevent any unintended release of a version that included the bug.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We are taking the following steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\nTo improve resolution time for future issues of this type, we are calibrating our alerting system to give us an earlier and more precise notification which will allow us to diagnose the issue more quickly.\nWe are also evaluating what kinds of load/stress tests could deterministically detect this kind of issue in the future, so that such regressions are caught automatically before they are deployed to production.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn 28th April 2022 from 7:00 PT to 8:32 PT\n**Google App Engine**\nGoogle App Engine experienced increased latency and reduced availability in one zone in us-central1 for a period of 1 hour and 32 minutes. Customers may have experienced increased latency or higher error rate for App Engine projects.\n**Google Cloud Functions**\nGoogle Cloud Functions experienced increased latency and reduced availability in one zone in us-central1 for a period of 1 hour and 32 minutes. “Google Cloud Functions” customers updating their functions (e.g. deploying a new version) may have experienced increased latency or failures, notably failing health checks.\n**Google Cloud Support and Google Workspace Support**\nCustomers were unable to create, view, or search support cases in the Google Cloud Support Center or Google Admin Console for 1 hour and 24 minutes. In addition, a small number of customers had degraded access to phone support, being redirected to a queue requiring additional manual authentication with the support agent.",

Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for a duration of 20 hours, 41 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, an unexpected increase in uncached NOT_FOUND errors while validating log bucket configurations caused a large increase in the overall volume of configuration reads. This in turn caused latency of configuration reads and therefore validations to increase, leading to an ingestion backlog and a delay in log ingestion to the storage layer of our query backend.\nThe issue was resolved at 17:33 US/Pacific once the ingestion backlog cleared.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for most of the duration of the event.\n- Customers may have experienced high latency or failures up to 90% on reads from Google Cloud Logging and other query requests.",

Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for a duration of 20 hours, 41 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, an unexpected increase in uncached NOT_FOUND errors while validating log bucket configurations caused a large increase in the overall volume of configuration reads. This in turn caused latency of configuration reads and therefore validations to increase, leading to an ingestion backlog and a delay in log ingestion to the storage layer of our query backend.\nThe issue was resolved at 17:33 US/Pacific once the ingestion backlog cleared.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for most of the duration of the event.\n- Customers may have experienced high latency or failures up to 90% on reads from Google Cloud Logging and other query requests.",

Google apologizes to customers who were affected by this outage and is taking steps to ensure that this type of outage does not reoccur.\n**Root Cause**\nOur investigation found the cause was a backend configuration change to our Cloud Monitoring service. This configuration changed the computation of some metrics not directly related to, but shared by, Cloud Pub/Sub. This configuration change progressively rolled out across all Google Cloud regions over two hours.\nThis configuration change increased the latency of requests to record metrics sent from Cloud Pub/Sub to Cloud Monitoring and, in some cases, resulted in failures due to write operations timing out.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nEngineers were able to mitigate the issue by reverting the change that caused the issue, restoring services for all customers at 15:54 US/Pacific.\nWe are taking the following actions to ensure this does not happen again:\n- Improving the monitoring of Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting to allow for quicker error detection.\n- Making Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting operations more resilient to high latency.\n- Improving internal visibility and vetting of Cloud Monitoring backend configuration changes.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Thursday March 31st, between 08:30 and 15:54 US/Pacific time:\n**Cloud Pub/Sub Metrics in Cloud Reporting**\n- The metric values lost during this timeframe are not recoverable.\n- Any alerting based on these metrics might have fired erroneously or not fired when it should have.\n- Auto scaling of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) based on these metrics may not have functioned as expected.",

Google apologizes to customers who were affected by this outage and is taking steps to ensure that this type of outage does not reoccur.\n**Root Cause**\nOur investigation found the cause was a backend configuration change to our Cloud Monitoring service. This configuration changed the computation of some metrics not directly related to, but shared by, Cloud Pub/Sub. This configuration change progressively rolled out across all Google Cloud regions over two hours.\nThis configuration change increased the latency of requests to record metrics sent from Cloud Pub/Sub to Cloud Monitoring and, in some cases, resulted in failures due to write operations timing out.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nEngineers were able to mitigate the issue by reverting the change that caused the issue, restoring services for all customers at 15:54 US/Pacific.\nWe are taking the following actions to ensure this does not happen again:\n- Improving the monitoring of Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting to allow for quicker error detection.\n- Making Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting operations more resilient to high latency.\n- Improving internal visibility and vetting of Cloud Monitoring backend configuration changes.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Thursday March 31st, between 08:30 and 15:54 US/Pacific time:\n**Cloud Pub/Sub Metrics in Cloud Reporting**\n- The metric values lost during this timeframe are not recoverable.\n- Any alerting based on these metrics might have fired erroneously or not fired when it should have.\n- Auto scaling of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) based on these metrics may not have functioned as expected.",

        "text": "**Summary**\nOn Tuesday, 22 March 2022, Google Cloud Networking experienced congestion on network infrastructure to and from the network edge locations [1] in Queretaro, Mexico, for a duration of 1 hour and 45 minutes, following multiple fiber cuts between the United States and Mexico. Affected customers may have experienced high latency, high retransmits and elevated errors.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s wide-area network is primarily comprised of infrastructure owned and operated by Google, although some physical links use fiber infrastructure which is owned and operated by third parties. Google has multiple resilient fiber paths and network points of presence serving users in Mexico.\nMultiple simultaneous fiber cuts on diversely-routed paths, at the same time as a planned maintenance event on another diversely-routed path, resulted in a capacity shortfall in Google’s wide-area network between Queretaro, Mexico and the United States. This multiple failure event represents a rare case in which the resulting capacity shortfall was visible to Google's users.\nTraffic was subsequently redirected to alternate links; however, there was insufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss for user-facing network traffic to Google from users in Mexico.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanism detected the congestion on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 15:42 US/Pacific and redirected the traffic through alternate edge locations. However, the alternate link did not have sufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss. The congestion was cleared when traffic was manually routed around the failed links on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 17:15 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. However, this incident was the result of multiple concurrent failures on links which are designed to provide resilience; such failures, whilst very rare, are expected at a low frequency. We are taking the following steps to ensure we respond quickly to similar events in the future:\n* Improving the reliability of tooling that manually reroutes traffic in extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\n* Improving the diagnostic systems that help Google's Cloud Networking teams decide how to deal with extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\nWe appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 22 March 2022 from 15:30 to 17:15 US/Pacific, customers reaching Google services from Mexico may have experienced network slowness and packet loss, and errors returned from our services. This may have resulted in customers not being able to access services running on Google Cloud and Workspace services including:\n* Google Meet\n* Gmail\n* Google Drive",

      "text": "**Summary**\nOn Tuesday, 22 March 2022, Google Cloud Networking experienced congestion on network infrastructure to and from the network edge locations [1] in Queretaro, Mexico, for a duration of 1 hour and 45 minutes, following multiple fiber cuts between the United States and Mexico. Affected customers may have experienced high latency, high retransmits and elevated errors.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s wide-area network is primarily comprised of infrastructure owned and operated by Google, although some physical links use fiber infrastructure which is owned and operated by third parties. Google has multiple resilient fiber paths and network points of presence serving users in Mexico.\nMultiple simultaneous fiber cuts on diversely-routed paths, at the same time as a planned maintenance event on another diversely-routed path, resulted in a capacity shortfall in Google’s wide-area network between Queretaro, Mexico and the United States. This multiple failure event represents a rare case in which the resulting capacity shortfall was visible to Google's users.\nTraffic was subsequently redirected to alternate links; however, there was insufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss for user-facing network traffic to Google from users in Mexico.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanism detected the congestion on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 15:42 US/Pacific and redirected the traffic through alternate edge locations. However, the alternate link did not have sufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss. The congestion was cleared when traffic was manually routed around the failed links on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 17:15 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. However, this incident was the result of multiple concurrent failures on links which are designed to provide resilience; such failures, whilst very rare, are expected at a low frequency. We are taking the following steps to ensure we respond quickly to similar events in the future:\n* Improving the reliability of tooling that manually reroutes traffic in extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\n* Improving the diagnostic systems that help Google's Cloud Networking teams decide how to deal with extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\nWe appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 22 March 2022 from 15:30 to 17:15 US/Pacific, customers reaching Google services from Mexico may have experienced network slowness and packet loss, and errors returned from our services. This may have resulted in customers not being able to access services running on Google Cloud and Workspace services including:\n* Google Meet\n* Gmail\n* Google Drive",

The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 15:28 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA rare hardware failure of a component on the fiber paths from one of the transpacific gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:20 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:28 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this rare event affected our customers. We have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve still further remain ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions.

      "text": "**Summary**\nOn Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:20 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Networking experienced intermittent packet loss for traffic between multiple cloud regions for a duration of 8 minutes. The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 15:28 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA rare hardware failure of a component on the fiber paths from one of the transpacific gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:20 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:28 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this rare event affected our customers. We have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve still further remain ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nCustomers may have observed packet loss for traffic routed via transpacific links on Google's backbone. This could include traffic from or to any of the following cloud regions:\n* asia-east1\n* asia-northeast1\n* asia-northeast2\n* asia-northeast3\n* asia-southeast1\n* asia-southeast2\n* australia-southeast1\n* australia-southeast2\n* us-west1\n* us-central1\n* us-east1\n* us-east4\n* northamerica-northeast1\n* europe-west1\n* europe-west2\n* europe-west3\n* europe-west4\n* europe-west6\n* europe-west8\n* europe-west9\n* europe-central2\n* europe-north1",
