Consequently, multiple other Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products relying on GCE also experienced increased latencies and timeouts.\nTo our customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nA recently deployed configuration change to a Google Compute Engine (GCE) component mistakenly disabled a feature flag that controlled how VM instance states are reported to other components. Safety checks intended to ensure gradual rollout of this type of change failed to be triggered, resulting in an unplanned rapid rollout of the change.\nThis caused Spot VMs to be stuck in an unexpected state. Consequently, Spot VMs that had initiated their standard termination process due to preemption began to accumulate as they failed to complete termination, creating a backlog that degraded performance for all VM types in some regions.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via internal monitoring on 19 May 2025, at 21:08 US/Pacific, and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers initiated a rollback of the change on 20 May 2025 at 03:29 US/Pacific.\nThe rollback completed at 03:55 US/Pacific, mitigating the impact.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Google Cloud employs a robust and well-defined methodology for production updates, including a phased rollout approach as standard practice to avoid rapid global changes. This phased approach is meant to ensure that changes are introduced into production gradually and as safely as possible, however, in this case, the safety checks were not enforced. We have paused further feature flag rollouts for the affected system, while we undertake a comprehensive audit of safety checks and fix any exposed gaps that led to the unplanned rapid rollout of this change.\n* We will review and address scalability issues encountered by GCE during the incident.\n* We will improve monitoring coverage of Spot VM deletion workflows.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nCustomers experienced increased latency for VM control plane operations in us-central1 and us-east4. VM control plane operations include creating, modifying, or deleting VMs. For some customers, Spot VM instances became stuck while terminating. Customers were not billed for Spot VM instances in this state. Furthermore, running virtual machines and the data plane were not impacted.\nVM control plane latency in the us-central1 and us-east4 regions began increasing at the start of the incident (19 May 2025 20:23 US/Pacific), and peaked around 20 May 2025 03:40 US/Pacific. At peak, median latency went from seconds to minutes, and tail latency went from minutes to hours. Several other regions experienced increased tail latency during the outage, but most operations in these regions completed as normal. Once mitigations took effect, median and tail latencies started falling and returned to normal by 05:15 US/Pacific.\nCustomers may have experienced similar latency increases in products which create, modify, failover or delete VM instances: GCE, GKE, Dataflow, Cloud SQL, Google Cloud Dataproc, Google App Engine, Cloud Deploy, Memorystore, Redis, Cloud Filestore, among others.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using [***https://cloud.google.com/support***](https://cloud.google.com/support).\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 19 May 2025 20:23:00\n**Incident End:** 20 May 2025 05:05:00\n**Duration:** 8 hours, 42 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud SQL, AlloyDb for PostgreSQL, Cloud Composer, Cloud Build, Cloud Dataproc, Google App Engine, Migrate to Virtual Machines, Vertex GenAI, Cloud Deploy and Memorystore for Redis.\n**Regions/Zones:**\n***VM creation issues:***\n* us-central1 all zones\n* us-east4 all zones\n***VM termination issues:***\nasia-east1, asia-northeast1, asia-south1, asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-central2, europe-north1, europe-west1, europe-west12, europe-west2, europe-west3, europe-west4, me-central2, southamerica-east1, us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-east5, us-west1, us-west2, us-west4\n**Note:** VM terminate operations, products dependent on VM creations and terminations may have seen impact outside the above zones.\n**Description:**\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) encountered problems affecting VM creation, termination, and reservation consumption. Consequently, multiple Google Cloud products experienced increased latencies and timeouts during create, update, and terminate operations.\nPreliminary analysis indicates that a recent configuration change negatively impacted GCE handling of routine spot virtual machine (VM) terminations. As a result of this problem, GCE Control Plane services became overloaded causing disruptions for VM Instance creation, termination, and reservation consumption.\nThe issue was mitigated by changing the configuration to the previous state, thereby resolving the impact on all affected products.\nGoogle will complete a full Incident Report in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n**Google Compute Engine:** Customers may have observed elevated latency or timeouts for VM Instance operations like creation, reservation consumption, etc.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine:** Customers may have observed latency while performing operations like creating or deleting clusters, adding or resizing nodepools, etc.\n**Google Cloud Dataproc:** Customers may have observed elevated latency while performing operations like creating or deleting clusters, and scale up and scale down operations, etc.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:** Customers may have observed elevated latency for start-up / scaleup / shut-downs for Dataflow jobs.\n**Cloud Filestore:** Customers may have observed create instance failures.\n**Cloud Build:** Customers using private pools may have observed elevated latency in build completion or sporadic build failures due to workers failing to start.\n**Cloud SQL:** Customers may have observed failures or elevated latency for instance creation, resizing and high-availability update operations. As a workaround, for failure in the create operations, customers can retry by deleting the failed instances and re-attempt the operation.\n**Cloud Composer:** Customers may have experienced failures in new Composer environment creation and in upgrade of Composer/Airflow versions, as well as delays in up-scaling of new airflow-workers and in KubernetesPodOperator tasks.\n**AlloyDB for PostgreSQL:** Customers may have experienced failures in instance creation operations. In addition, a small number of instance update operations may also see failures.\n**Google App Engine:** Customers may have experienced failures in insert/update/create/delete operations.\n**Migrate to Virtual Machines:** Customers may have experienced timeouts or errors.\n**Vertex GenAI:** Customers may have experienced issues in creating cluster operations.\n**Cloud Deploy:** Customers may have experienced Cloud Deploy operations (e.g. Render, Deploy, Verify, etc.) as “in progress” for a long time or failed to start.\n**Memorystore for Redis:** Customers may have experienced increased latency or timeouts for some CreateCluster operations.\n------",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary:\nOn Saturday, 29 March 2025, multiple Google Cloud Services in the us-east5-c zone experienced degraded service or unavailability for a duration of 6 hours and 10 minutes. To our Google Cloud customers whose services were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause:\nThe root cause of the service disruption was a loss of utility power in the affected zone. This power outage triggered a cascading failure within the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system responsible for maintaining power to the zone during such events. The UPS system, which relies on batteries to bridge the gap between utility power loss and generator power activation, experienced a critical battery failure.\nThis failure rendered the UPS unable to perform its core function of ensuring continuous power to the system. As a direct consequence of the UPS failure, virtual machine instances within the affected zone lost power and went offline, resulting in service downtime for customers. The power outage and subsequent UPS failure also triggered a series of secondary issues, including packet loss within the us-east5-c zone, which impacted network communication and performance. Additionally, a limited number of storage disks within the zone became unavailable during the outage.\n## Remediation and Prevention:\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the incident from our internal monitoring alerts at 12:54 US/Pacific on Saturday, 29 March and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineers diverted traffic away from the impacted location to partially mitigate impact for some services that did not have zonal resource dependencies. Engineers bypassed the failed UPS and restored power via generator by 14:49 US/Pacific on Saturday, 29 March. The majority of Google Cloud services recovered shortly thereafter. A few services experienced longer restoration times as manual actions were required in some cases to complete full recovery.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Harden cluster power failure and recovery path to achieve a predictable and faster time-to-serving after power is restored.\n* Audit systems that did not automatically failover and close any gaps that prevented this function.\n* Work with our uninterruptible power supply (UPS) vendor to understand and remediate issues in the battery backup system.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact:\nCustomers experienced degraded service or unavailability for multiple Google Cloud products in the us-east5-c zone of varying impact and severity as noted below:\n**AlloyDB for PostgreSQL:** A few clusters experienced transient unavailability during the failover. Two impacted clusters did not failover automatically and required manual intervention from Google engineers to do the failover.\n**BigQuery:** A few customers in the impacted region experienced brief unavailability of the product between 12:57 US/Pacific until 13:19 US/Pacific.\n**Cloud Bigtable:** The outage resulted in increased errors and latency for a few customers between 12:47 US/Pacific to 19:37 US/Pacific.\n**Cloud Composer:** External streaming jobs for a few customers experienced increased latency for a period of 16 minutes.\n**Cloud Dataflow:** Streaming and batch jobs saw brief periods of performance degradation. 17% of streaming jobs experienced degradation from 12:52 US/Pacific to 13:08 US/Pacific, while 14% of batch jobs experienced degradation from 15:42 US/Pacific to 16:00 US/Pacific.\n**Cloud Filestore:** All basic, high scale and zonal instances in us-east5-c were unavailable and all enterprise and regional instances in us-east5 were operating in degraded mode from 12:54 to 18:47 US/Pacific on Saturday, 29 March 2025\\.\n**Cloud Firestore:** Limited impact of approximately 2 minutes where customers experienced elevated unavailability and latency, as jobs were being rerouted automatically.\n**Cloud Identity and Access Management:** A few customers experienced slight latency or errors while retrying for a short period of time.\n**Cloud Interconnect:** All us-east5 attachments connected to zone1 were unavailable for a duration of 2 hours, 7 minutes.\n**Cloud Key Management Service:** Customers experienced 5XX errors for a brief period of time (less than 4 mins). Google engineers rerouted the traffic to healthy cells shortly after the power loss to mitigate the impact.\n**Cloud Kubernetes Engine:** Customers experienced terminations of their nodes in us-east5-c. Some zonal clusters in us-east5-c experienced loss of connectivity to their control plane. No impact was observed for nodes or control planes outside of us-east5-c.\n**Cloud NAT:** Transient control plane outage affecting new VM creation processes and/or dynamic port allocation.\n**Cloud Router:** Cloud Router was unavailable for up to 30 seconds while leadership shifted to other clusters. This downtime was within the thresholds of most customer's graceful restart configuration (60 seconds).\n**Cloud SQL:** Based on monitoring data, 318 zonal instances experienced 3h of downtime in the us-east5-c zone. All external high-availability instances successfully failed out of the impacted zone.\n**Cloud Spanner:** Customers in the us-east5 region may have seen a few minutes of errors or latency increase during the few minutes after 12:52 US/Pacific when the cluster first failed.\n**Cloud VPN:** A few legacy customers experienced loss of connectivity of their sessions up to 5 mins.\n**Compute Engine:** Customers experienced instance unavailability and inability to manage instances in us-east5-c from 12:54 to 18:30 US/Pacific on Saturday, 29 March 2025\\.\n**Managed Service for Apache Kafka:** CreateCluster and some UpdateCluster commands (those that increased capacity config) had a 100% error rate in the region, with the symptom being INTERNAL errors or timeouts. Based on our monitoring, the impact was limited to one customer who attempted to use these methods during the incident.\n**Memorystore for Redis:** High availability instances failed over to healthy zones during the incident. 12 instances required manual intervention to bring back provisioned capacity. All instances were recovered by 19:28 US/Pacific.\n**Persistent Disk:** Customers experienced very high I/O latency, including stalled I/O operations or errors in some disks in us-east5-c from 12:54 US/Pacific to 20:45 US/Pacific on Saturday, 29 March 2025\\. Other products using PD or communicating with impacted PD devices experienced service issues with varied symptoms.\n**Secret Manager:** Customers experienced 5XX errors for a brief period of time (less than 4 mins). Google engineers rerouted the traffic to healthy cells shortly after the power loss to mitigate the impact.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:** Virtual machine instances running in the us-east5-c zone were unable to reach the network. Services were partially unavailable from the impacted zone. Customers wherever applicable were able to fail over workloads to different Cloud zones.",

This failure prevented the UPS from operating correctly, thereby preventing a power source transfer to generators during the utility power outage. As a result, some Compute Engine instances in the zone experienced downtime. The incident also caused some packet loss within the us-east5-c zone, as well as some capacity constraints for Google Kubernetes Engine in other zones of us-east5. Additionally, a small number of Persistent Disks were unavailable during the outage.\nGoogle engineers diverted traffic away from the impacted location to partially mitigate impact for some services that did not have zonal resource dependencies. Engineers bypassed the failed UPS and restored power via generator, allowing the underlying infrastructure to come back online. Impact to all affected Cloud services was mitigated by 29 March 2025 at 19:12 US/Pacific.\nGoogle will complete a full Incident Report in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause analysis.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers experienced degraded service or zonal unavailability for multiple Google Cloud products in us-east5-c.\n**Additional details:**\nThe us-east5-c zone has transitioned back to primary power without further impact as of 30 March 2025 at 17:30 US/Pacific.",

Around 60% of the requests were impacted in us-east4 and europe-west4 for a duration of 1 hour and 50 minutes.\nWe sincerely apologize to our Google Cloud customers for the disruption you experienced.\n## Root Cause\nA database schema migration in production triggered a cascading incident. The migration caused failures and timeouts on the primary database, disrupting most AppSheet operations and preventing apps loading for users in us-east4 and europe-west4. The sustained outage occurred due to a surge of retries, overloading the secondary authentication database and rendering it completely unresponsive for requests to the affected regions. The authentication database is responsible for storing user authentication tokens.\nTraffic was migrated to the us-central1 and us-west1 regions, after which issues pertaining to user auth tokens were resolved.\nHowever, this triggered an increase in load on our service for validating users’ Workspace license entitlements, due to that information no longer being available in cache. The request rate went up significantly, triggering aggressive load shedding, resulting in elevated latency for 95% of the traffic. This further aggravated latency after traffic migration to us-central1 and us-west1 was performed.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via an automated alert on 24 January 2025 09:42 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. To mitigate the impact, engineers redirected the traffic from us-east4 and europe-west4, to us-central1 and us-west1.\nThe resultant load shedding that occurred on the licensing server recovered by 11:20 US/Pacific, once we restored our authentication database and gradually reverted traffic to us-east4 and europe-west4.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions: - Improve alerting and monitoring of on license server traffic to reduce impact on latencies when traffic migration happens. - Gradually reduce dependency on licensing servers to avoid failures arising from either increased traffic, or unavailability of licensing servers. - We are reviewing measures to increase the stability of our authentication database, to ensure optimal handling of any surge in requests.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Friday, 24 January 2025, from 09:30 to 11:20 US/Pacific, approximately 60% of the AppSheet requests in us-east4 and europe-west4 may have failed. - Affected customers were unable to load AppSheet apps with the app editor or the app load page. - Affected customers experienced elevated ‘500’ errors and timeouts. - Some customers may also have observed intermittent latency.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n**(All Times US/Pacific)**\n**Incident Start:** 24 January, 2025 09:30\n**Incident End:** 24 January, 2025 11:20\n**Duration:** 1 hour, 50 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nAppSheet\n**Regions/Zones:**\nus-east4 and europe-west4\n**Description:**\nAppSheet experienced availability issues in us-west4 and europe-west4 for a total duration of 1 hour, 50 minutes.\nFrom our preliminary analysis, a schema migration initiated on a backend database caused errors and request timeouts. This led to increased retries from clients, causing a secondary database that manages authentication for us-east4 and europe-west4 to become overloaded. The overload on the authentication database subsequently impacted another dependency licensing server which also became overloaded.\nWhile the original database issues caused by the schema migration were fully resolved, the authentication and licensing servers continued to observe issues. Google engineers mitigated the overloaded authentication database by shifting traffic away from us-east4 and europe-west4 regions, resolving the issue. The licensing server recovered by 11:20 US/Pacific due to organic traffic reduction.\nGoogle will complete a full Incident Report in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Affected customers were unable to load AppSheet apps with the editor app load page.\n* Affected customers experienced elevated 500 errors and timeouts.\n* Some customers may also have observed intermittent latency.\n---",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 8 January 2025 06:54 to 08:07 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Pub/Sub experienced a service outage in multiple regions resulting in customers unable to publish or subscribe to the messages for a duration of 1 hour and 13 minutes.\nThis outage also resulted in an increased backlog which was identified at 8 January 2025 09:07 US/Pacific for a small subset of customer subscriptions using message ordering[1], which extended beyond the unavailability time window. These subscriptions were repaired and mitigated by 8 January 2025 23:09 US/Pacific.\nWe deeply regret the disruption this outage caused for our Google Cloud customers. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Pub/Sub uses a regional database for the metadata state of its storage system, including information about published messages and the order in which those messages were published for ordered delivery. The regional metadata database is on the critical path of most of the Cloud Pub/Sub data plane operations. From 8 January 2025 06:54 to 07:30 US/Pacific, a bad service configuration change, which unintentionally over-restricted the permission to access this database, was rolled out to multiple regions. The issue did not surface in our pre-production environment due to a mismatch in the configuration between the two environments. In addition, the change was mistakenly rolled out to multiple regions within a short time period and did not follow the standard rollout process. This change prevented Cloud Pub/Sub from accessing the regional metadata store, leading to publish, subscribe, and backlog metrics failures and unavailability impact, which was mitigated on 8 January 2025 08:07 US/Pacific.\nThough the configuration change was rolled back and mitigated on 8 January 2025 08:07 US/Pacific, the database unavailability during the issue exposed a latent bug in the way Cloud Pub/Sub enforces ordered delivery for subscriptions with ordering enabled. In particular, when the database was unavailable for an extended period of time, the metadata pertaining to ordering became inconsistent with the metadata about published messages. This inconsistency prevented the delivery of a subset of messages until the subscriptions were repaired, and they received all backlogged messages in the proper order. Mitigation was completed by 8 January 2025 23:09 US/Pacific. Note that this did not impact ordering or guaranteed delivery.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via internal telemetry on 8 January 2025 07:03 US/Pacific, 9 minutes after impact started. The config change that caused the issue was identified and rollback completed by 8 January 2025 08:07 US/Pacific. At 8 January 2025 09:07 US/Pacific, Google engineers were alerted via internal telemetry to the fact that a small subset of ordered subscriptions were unable to consume their backlog and root caused the metadata inconsistency at 8 January 2025 12:20 US/Pacific. Google engineers worked on identifying and repairing all impacted ordered subscriptions, which was completed by 8 January 2025 23:09 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Our engineering team is working on implementing stronger enforcement of parity between pre-production and production environments in order to ensure the impact of configuration changes can be caught before changes move to production. ETA: 31 January 2025.\n* We are reviewing our change management process to ensure that future configuration changes roll out in a progressive fashion aligned with the priority of the change. ETA: 31 January 2025.\n* We are working on implementing additional monitoring that proactively detects ordering metadata inconsistency. ETA: 31 March 2025.\n* We are implementing a fix to the Cloud Pub/Sub ordering metadata management bug, which led to undelivered, ordered messages. ETA: 30 June 2025.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Wednesday 8 January 2025 from 06:54 to 08:07 US/Pacific Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Logging, and BigQuery Data Transfer Service experienced a service outage in europe-west10, asia-south1, europe-west1, us-central1, asia-southeast2, us-east1, us-east5, asia-south2, us-south1, me-central1 regions.\nCustomers publishing from other regions may have also experienced the issue if the message storage policies [2] are set to store and process the messages in the above-mentioned regions.\n#### Google Cloud Pub/Sub : Customers were unable to publish or subscribe to the messages in the impacted regions. Publishing the messages from other regions may also have been impacted, if they have any of the impacted regions in their message storage policies. Backlog metrics might have been stale or missing.\n#### Google BigQuery Data Transfer Service : Customers experienced failures with data transfers runs failing to publish to Pub/Sub for a duration of 20 minutes.\n#### Cloud Logging : All Cloud Logs customers exporting logs to Cloud Pub/Sub experienced a delay in the log export for a duration of 26 minutes.\n**Appendix:**\n* [1] https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering\n* [2] https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/resource-location-restriction#message_storage_policy_overview",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 8 January 2025 06:54 to 08:07 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Pub/Sub experienced a service outage in multiple regions resulting in customers unable to publish or subscribe to the messages for a duration of 1 hour and 13 minutes.\nThis outage also resulted in an increased backlog which was identified at 8 January 2025 09:07 US/Pacific for a small subset of customer subscriptions using message ordering[1], which extended beyond the unavailability time window. These subscriptions were repaired and mitigated by 8 January 2025 23:09 US/Pacific.\nWe deeply regret the disruption this outage caused for our Google Cloud customers. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Pub/Sub uses a regional database for the metadata state of its storage system, including information about published messages and the order in which those messages were published for ordered delivery. The regional metadata database is on the critical path of most of the Cloud Pub/Sub data plane operations. From 8 January 2025 06:54 to 07:30 US/Pacific, a bad service configuration change, which unintentionally over-restricted the permission to access this database, was rolled out to multiple regions. The issue did not surface in our pre-production environment due to a mismatch in the configuration between the two environments. In addition, the change was mistakenly rolled out to multiple regions within a short time period and did not follow the standard rollout process. This change prevented Cloud Pub/Sub from accessing the regional metadata store, leading to publish, subscribe, and backlog metrics failures and unavailability impact, which was mitigated on 8 January 2025 08:07 US/Pacific.\nThough the configuration change was rolled back and mitigated on 8 January 2025 08:07 US/Pacific, the database unavailability during the issue exposed a latent bug in the way Cloud Pub/Sub enforces ordered delivery for subscriptions with ordering enabled. In particular, when the database was unavailable for an extended period of time, the metadata pertaining to ordering became inconsistent with the metadata about published messages. This inconsistency prevented the delivery of a subset of messages until the subscriptions were repaired, and they received all backlogged messages in the proper order. Mitigation was completed by 8 January 2025 23:09 US/Pacific. Note that this did not impact ordering or guaranteed delivery.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via internal telemetry on 8 January 2025 07:03 US/Pacific, 9 minutes after impact started. The config change that caused the issue was identified and rollback completed by 8 January 2025 08:07 US/Pacific. At 8 January 2025 09:07 US/Pacific, Google engineers were alerted via internal telemetry to the fact that a small subset of ordered subscriptions were unable to consume their backlog and root caused the metadata inconsistency at 8 January 2025 12:20 US/Pacific. Google engineers worked on identifying and repairing all impacted ordered subscriptions, which was completed by 8 January 2025 23:09 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Our engineering team is working on implementing stronger enforcement of parity between pre-production and production environments in order to ensure the impact of configuration changes can be caught before changes move to production. ETA: 31 January 2025.\n* We are reviewing our change management process to ensure that future configuration changes roll out in a progressive fashion aligned with the priority of the change. ETA: 31 January 2025.\n* We are working on implementing additional monitoring that proactively detects ordering metadata inconsistency. ETA: 31 March 2025.\n* We are implementing a fix to the Cloud Pub/Sub ordering metadata management bug, which led to undelivered, ordered messages. ETA: 30 June 2025.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Wednesday 8 January 2025 from 06:54 to 08:07 US/Pacific Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Logging, and BigQuery Data Transfer Service experienced a service outage in europe-west10, asia-south1, europe-west1, us-central1, asia-southeast2, us-east1, us-east5, asia-south2, us-south1, me-central1 regions.\nCustomers publishing from other regions may have also experienced the issue if the message storage policies [2] are set to store and process the messages in the above-mentioned regions.\n#### Google Cloud Pub/Sub : Customers were unable to publish or subscribe to the messages in the impacted regions. Publishing the messages from other regions may also have been impacted, if they have any of the impacted regions in their message storage policies. Backlog metrics might have been stale or missing.\n#### Google BigQuery Data Transfer Service : Customers experienced failures with data transfers runs failing to publish to Pub/Sub for a duration of 20 minutes.\n#### Cloud Logging : All Cloud Logs customers exporting logs to Cloud Pub/Sub experienced a delay in the log export for a duration of 26 minutes.\n**Appendix:**\n* [1] https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering\n* [2] https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/resource-location-restriction#message_storage_policy_overview",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the incident is stemmed from a Vertex service dependency ending up in a bad state due to a configuration process.\nThe situation was mitigated by increasing resources, enabling successful autopilot scaling and reducing customer traffic errors. Additionally, the Vertex service dependency received an update to fix the configuration, preventing recurrence of the Incident.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers sending traffic to gemini models in multi-region:asia experienced an increase in 5xx errors up to 100%.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support .\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 19 December, 2024 08:15\n**Incident End:** 19 December, 2024 10:55\n**Duration:** 2 hours, 40 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nVertex Gemini API\n**Regions/Zones:** multi-region:asia\n**Description:**\nGoogle Vertex Gemini API customers sending traffic to gemini models in multi-region:asia experienced an increase in 5xx errors up to 100% for a duration of 2 hours, 40 minutes. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the incident is stemmed from a Vertex service dependency ending up in a bad state due to a configuration process.\nThe situation was mitigated by increasing resources, enabling successful autopilot scaling and reducing customer traffic errors. Additionally, the Vertex service dependency received an update to fix the configuration, preventing recurrence of the Incident.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers sending traffic to gemini models in multi-region:asia experienced an increase in 5xx errors up to 100%.",

BigQuery Write API customers also saw an increase in latency for some requests during this time. Also, Dataflow customers may have experienced an increase in latency by 5-15%. The impact lasted for a duration of 2 hours and 16 minutes.\nTo our BigQuery and Dataflow customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nDataflow depends on BigQuery to write streaming data to a table. BigQuery uses a streaming backend service to persist data. This streaming backend service in one of the clusters in the US multi-region experienced a high number of concurrent connections caused by a slightly higher than usual customer traffic fluctuation. This backend service enforces a limit on the number of such concurrent connections for flow control and a bug in its mechanism prevented backends from accepting new requests once this limit was reached.\nDue to reduced bandwidth in the backend servers in the cluster, the regional streaming frontends experienced higher latency and started accumulating more inflight requests. This led to their overload and regional impact to BigQuery and Dataflow streaming customers outside the affected cluster.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage by our internal monitoring system on Monday, 9 December 2024 at 09:33 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nAfter a thorough investigation, the impacted backend cluster was identified. Initial mitigation attempt focused on reducing server load through traffic throttling. To achieve complete mitigation, our engineers then drained the affected cluster, resulting in immediate and complete recovery.\nGoogle is committed to preventing this issue from repeating in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Fix the root cause in the backend service to handle surges in concurrent connections and avoid zonal impact.\n* Improve testing coverage of the backend service to prevent similar issues.\n* Enhance the ability to detect and automatically mitigate similar cases of zonal impact.\n* Improve isolation to prevent issues in a particular cluster or availability zone from impacting all users in the region.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday 9 December 2024 from 09:24 to 11:40 US/Pacific BigQuery and Dataflow customers experienced increased latency and elevated error rates in US multi-region.\n### Google BigQuery\n* 80-90% of all requests for the insertAll API failed with a ‘5xx’ status code in US multi-region. Tail latency also increased substantially from <100ms to ~30 seconds during this time.\n* Additionally, AppendRows requests for the Write API saw increased tail latency (99.99%) from <3 seconds to ~30 seconds during this time.\n### Cloud Dataflow\n* 5-15% of Dataflow streaming jobs may have experienced increased latency in us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west2 and us-central1 regions for the duration of the incident.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 9 December 2024 09:24\n**Incident End:** 9 December 2024 11:40\n**Duration:** 2 hours, 24 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle BigQuery\nCloud Dataflow\n**Regions/Zones:**\n* Google BigQuery - US multi-region\n* Cloud Dataflow - us-west1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west2 & us-central1 were the most impacted but all Dataflow pipelines writing to the BigQuery US multi-region have likely been impacted too.\n**Description:**\nGoogle BigQuery experienced increased latency and elevated error rates in US multi-region for a duration of 2 hours, 24 minutes. Cloud Dataflow customers also observed elevated latency in their streaming jobs to the BigQuery US multi-region. Preliminary analysis indicates that the root cause of the issue was a sudden burst of traffic, which overloaded and slowed the backend in the availability zone. This led to aggressive retries and overloaded the frontend service. The incident was mitigated by rate-limiting requests and by evacuating the slow availability zone.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n### Google BigQuery\n* During the incident, customers calling google.cloud.bigquery.v2.TableDataService.InsertAll API method may have experienced transient failures with 5XX status code, which should have succeeded after retries.\n* Customers using google.cloud.bigquery.storage.v1.AppendRows may have experienced increased latency during this incident.\n### Cloud Dataflow\n* Customers would have experienced increased latency for streaming jobs in the us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west2, and us-central1 regions.",

The incident affected users and tasks attempting to export data to Google Drive, resulting in failed export jobs.\nThe impacted users would have encountered “API key not valid” and “Failed to read the spreadsheet” errors for export jobs when accessing Google Drive. This resulted in service unavailability or failing jobs for the duration of this disruption for Google BigQuery.\nTo our BigQuery customers whose business analytics were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThis disruption of data export functionality was triggered by the deletion of an internal project containing essential API keys. This deletion was an unintended consequence of several contributing factors:\n- An internally used API key was flagged for a Google policy non-compliance and deemed no longer in use which led to the deleting of the API key.\n- Unclear Internal Google Project Ownership: The project ownership was not clearly recorded, and thus incorrectly associated with a deprecated service.\n- Outdated Information: The combination of the perceived lack of recent activity and the incorrect ownership led to the project being mistakenly classified as abandoned and deprecated.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the service degrading via a support case on 4 December 2024, at approximately 14:21 US/Pacific when users began experiencing failures in data export operations. Google Engineers were alerted to the service disruption through internal monitoring systems and user reports. Upon investigation, the deletion of the project was identified as the root cause.\nTo mitigate the impact, the project was restored at approximately 15:45 US/Pacific. This action successfully recovered the API keys and over time restored the data export functionality for all affected users. The final error related to this incident was observed at approximately 17:55 US/Pacific, indicating full service recovery.\nGoogle is committed to continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused and appreciate your understanding.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions.\n- **Remove dependency on API keys for BigQuery integrations with other Google services:** This will eliminate the entire failure mode.\n- **Implement accidental deletion protection for critical internal resources:** Use mechanisms like project liens to ensure that a critical resource cannot be deleted accidentally.\n- **Enhance Project Metadata:** We are implementing a process for regular review and validation of project ownership and metadata. This will ensure that critical information about project usage and status is accurate and up-to-date, reducing the risk of incorrect assumptions about project status.\n- **Strengthen Internal Processes and Access Controls:** We are strengthening our processes for deprecating and deleting projects, including mandatory reviews, impact assessments, and stakeholder approvals. This will prevent accidental deletion of critical projects and ensure that all potential impacts are thoroughly evaluated before any action is taken. We are also strengthening access controls for project deletion, ensuring that only authorized personnel with appropriate approvals can perform this action. This will add an additional layer of protection against unintended project deletion.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting on 4 December 2024, Google BigQuery experienced elevated error rates for data export operations to Google Drive globally. Between approximately 14:21 and 18:04 US/Pacific, users attempting to export data from BigQuery to Google Drive encountered failures, resulting in service disruption for this specific functionality.\nThe incident affected all regions and impacted users encountered errors such as \"API key not valid,\" \"Failed to read the spreadsheet,\" or \"[Error: 80324028]\". Internal error messages further specified the issue as \"Dremel returned third-party error from GDRIVE: FAILED_PRECONDITION: Encountered an error while creating temporary directory\" with an underlying status of \"Http(400) Bad Request, API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key.\"\n### Google BigQuery\nThis disruption specifically impacted users and automated tasks relying on the BigQuery to Google Drive export functionality. Export jobs initiated during this period failed to complete, preventing data transfer and potentially impacting downstream processes and workflows dependent on this data.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nStarting on 4 December 2024 at 14:30 US/Pacific, Google BigQuery experienced elevated invalid value and internal system errors globally for traffic related to BigQuery and Google Drive integration for 3 hours and 25 minutes. The incident affected users and tasks attempting to export data to Google Drive, resulting in failed export jobs.\nThe impacted users would have encountered “API key not valid” and “Failed to read the spreadsheet” errors for export jobs when accessing Google Drive. This resulted in service unavailability or failing jobs for the duration of this disruption for Google BigQuery.\nTo our BigQuery customers whose business analytics were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThis disruption of data export functionality was triggered by the deletion of an internal project containing essential API keys. This deletion was an unintended consequence of several contributing factors:\n- An internally used API key was flagged for a Google policy non-compliance and deemed no longer in use which led to the deleting of the API key.\n- Unclear Internal Google Project Ownership: The project ownership was not clearly recorded, and thus incorrectly associated with a deprecated service.\n- Outdated Information: The combination of the perceived lack of recent activity and the incorrect ownership led to the project being mistakenly classified as abandoned and deprecated.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the service degrading via a support case on 4 December 2024, at approximately 14:21 US/Pacific when users began experiencing failures in data export operations. Google Engineers were alerted to the service disruption through internal monitoring systems and user reports. Upon investigation, the deletion of the project was identified as the root cause.\nTo mitigate the impact, the project was restored at approximately 15:45 US/Pacific. This action successfully recovered the API keys and over time restored the data export functionality for all affected users. The final error related to this incident was observed at approximately 17:55 US/Pacific, indicating full service recovery.\nGoogle is committed to continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused and appreciate your understanding.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions.\n- **Remove dependency on API keys for BigQuery integrations with other Google services:** This will eliminate the entire failure mode.\n- **Implement accidental deletion protection for critical internal resources:** Use mechanisms like project liens to ensure that a critical resource cannot be deleted accidentally.\n- **Enhance Project Metadata:** We are implementing a process for regular review and validation of project ownership and metadata. This will ensure that critical information about project usage and status is accurate and up-to-date, reducing the risk of incorrect assumptions about project status.\n- **Strengthen Internal Processes and Access Controls:** We are strengthening our processes for deprecating and deleting projects, including mandatory reviews, impact assessments, and stakeholder approvals. This will prevent accidental deletion of critical projects and ensure that all potential impacts are thoroughly evaluated before any action is taken. We are also strengthening access controls for project deletion, ensuring that only authorized personnel with appropriate approvals can perform this action. This will add an additional layer of protection against unintended project deletion.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting on 4 December 2024, Google BigQuery experienced elevated error rates for data export operations to Google Drive globally. Between approximately 14:21 and 18:04 US/Pacific, users attempting to export data from BigQuery to Google Drive encountered failures, resulting in service disruption for this specific functionality.\nThe incident affected all regions and impacted users encountered errors such as \"API key not valid,\" \"Failed to read the spreadsheet,\" or \"[Error: 80324028]\". Internal error messages further specified the issue as \"Dremel returned third-party error from GDRIVE: FAILED_PRECONDITION: Encountered an error while creating temporary directory\" with an underlying status of \"Http(400) Bad Request, API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key.\"\n### Google BigQuery\nThis disruption specifically impacted users and automated tasks relying on the BigQuery to Google Drive export functionality. Export jobs initiated during this period failed to complete, preventing data transfer and potentially impacting downstream processes and workflows dependent on this data.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 16 November 2024 at 00:47 US/Pacific, a combination of fiber failures and a network equipment fault led to reduced network capacity between the asia-southeast2 region and other GCP regions. The failures were corrected and minimum required capacity recovered by 02:13 US/Pacific.\nTo our GCP customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause and Impact\nGoogle’s global network is designed and built to ensure that any occasional capacity loss events are not noticeable and/or have minimal disruption to customers. We provision several diverse network paths to each region and maintain sufficient capacity buffers based on the measured reliability of capacity in each region.\nBetween 12 November and 16 November, two separate fiber failures occurred near the asia-southeast2 region. These failures temporarily reduced the available network capacity between the asia-southeast2 region and other GCP regions, but did not impact the availability of GCP services in the region. Google engineers were alerted of these failures as soon as they occurred and were working with urgency on remediating these fiber failures but had not yet completed full recovery.\nOn 16 November 2024 at 00:47 US/Pacific, a latent software defect impacted a backbone networking router in the asia-southeast2 region resulting in further reduction of available inter-region capacity and exhausted our reserve network capacity buffers causing multiple Google Cloud services in the region to experience high latency and/or elevated error rates for operations requiring inter-region connectivity. During this time, customers in asia-southeast2, would have experienced issues with managing and monitoring existing resources, creating new resources, and data replication to other regions.\nTo mitigate the impact, Google engineers re-routed Internet traffic away from the asia-southeast2 region to be served from other GCP regions, primarily asia-southeast1 while working in parallel to recover the lost capacity. The faulty backbone networking router was recovered on 16 November 2024 02:13 US/Pacific. This ended the elevated network latency and error rates for most of the impacted GCP services’ operations. Recovery of the first failed fiber was completed on 18 November 08:45 US/Pacific and the second failed fiber was restored at 09:00 US/Pacific on the same day.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe’re taking the following actions to reduce the likelihood of recurrence and time to mitigate impact of this type of incident in the future:\n- During the incident, our actions to reroute traffic away from the asia-southeast2 region and recover the faulty backbone networking router took longer than expected as the loss of capacity hindered our visibility of required networking telemetry and functionality of emergency tooling. We’re reviewing these gaps to implement the required improvements to our network observability, emergency tools and incident response playbooks.\n- Work with our fiber partners in the asia-southeast2 region to ensure our fiber paths between facilities in the region and to submarine cable landing stations are on the most reliable routes available, and have adequate preventative maintenance and repair processes.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 16 November 2024 at 00:47 US/Pacific, a combination of fiber failures and a network equipment fault led to reduced network capacity between the asia-southeast2 region and other GCP regions. The failures were corrected and minimum required capacity recovered by 02:13 US/Pacific.\nTo our GCP customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause and Impact\nGoogle’s global network is designed and built to ensure that any occasional capacity loss events are not noticeable and/or have minimal disruption to customers. We provision several diverse network paths to each region and maintain sufficient capacity buffers based on the measured reliability of capacity in each region.\nBetween 12 November and 16 November, two separate fiber failures occurred near the asia-southeast2 region. These failures temporarily reduced the available network capacity between the asia-southeast2 region and other GCP regions, but did not impact the availability of GCP services in the region. Google engineers were alerted of these failures as soon as they occurred and were working with urgency on remediating these fiber failures but had not yet completed full recovery.\nOn 16 November 2024 at 00:47 US/Pacific, a latent software defect impacted a backbone networking router in the asia-southeast2 region resulting in further reduction of available inter-region capacity and exhausted our reserve network capacity buffers causing multiple Google Cloud services in the region to experience high latency and/or elevated error rates for operations requiring inter-region connectivity. During this time, customers in asia-southeast2, would have experienced issues with managing and monitoring existing resources, creating new resources, and data replication to other regions.\nTo mitigate the impact, Google engineers re-routed Internet traffic away from the asia-southeast2 region to be served from other GCP regions, primarily asia-southeast1 while working in parallel to recover the lost capacity. The faulty backbone networking router was recovered on 16 November 2024 02:13 US/Pacific. This ended the elevated network latency and error rates for most of the impacted GCP services’ operations. Recovery of the first failed fiber was completed on 18 November 08:45 US/Pacific and the second failed fiber was restored at 09:00 US/Pacific on the same day.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe’re taking the following actions to reduce the likelihood of recurrence and time to mitigate impact of this type of incident in the future:\n- During the incident, our actions to reroute traffic away from the asia-southeast2 region and recover the faulty backbone networking router took longer than expected as the loss of capacity hindered our visibility of required networking telemetry and functionality of emergency tooling. We’re reviewing these gaps to implement the required improvements to our network observability, emergency tools and incident response playbooks.\n- Work with our fiber partners in the asia-southeast2 region to ensure our fiber paths between facilities in the region and to submarine cable landing stations are on the most reliable routes available, and have adequate preventative maintenance and repair processes.",

Throughout the incident duration of 6 hours and 12 minutes, customers were unable to update existing chat, portal or email cases. Customers who attempted to create a support case were presented with our backup contact method and were able to receive support through this method which remained available throughout the outage.\n## Root Cause\nThe outage was triggered by a vendor-initiated change that impacted the performance of our support ticket persistence layer. This update inadvertently caused unavailability, specifically to the query subsystem of our support case management tool. After this configuration change was applied, the subsystem became unresponsive, preventing the processing of any read or write commands. As a result, customers and Google Support were unable to access or update support ticket data, leading to service disruption.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nOur monitoring systems detected elevated error rates and, at 22:09 US/Pacific, alerted our engineering team, who immediately started an investigation with the vendor. The vendor's incident team concluded that the query subsystem state would not be resolved by a configuration rollback. The vendor’s engineering team prepared a new update, validated it in a test environment, and applied the update to production, returning the system to service on 15 November 2024 at 04:09 US/Pacific.\nWe are taking immediate steps with the vendor to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n- A production change freeze for the vendor's query subsystem is in place until rollout safeguards are sufficient to prevent further impact.\n- We are working with the vendor to improve their change management process to ensure safer rollouts that avoid unexpected issues while also providing earlier detection of rollout change.\n- We will perform a review of rollback safety for configuration changes with the vendor to ensure rollback is always possible, reducing recovery time.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting on 14 November 2024 at 21:57 US/Pacific,\n- Customers observed increased latency and required multiple attempts when opening support cases. Customers were able to use the backup case creation process to receive support.\n- Customers were able to send and receive updates to existing support cases by email, but were not able to update cases using the support portal. Support agents were able to send update emails for cases, create pro-active bugs and fill Contact-Us-Forms (CUFs) on behalf of their customers. However, responding via the support portal was unavailable.\n- Customers with active chat support cases were unable to continue their conversation. Error messages received by customers included options for continuing support via the Contact-Us-Forms (CUFs).\n- All contractual obligations for support requests submitted through the Contact-Us-Forms (CUFs) were fulfilled.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 14 November 2024 at 21:57 US/Pacific, our support ticketing system that handles Google Cloud, Billing, and Workspace customer support, experienced an unexpected issue during a vendor-planned maintenance event, causing the system to become unavailable. Throughout the incident duration of 6 hours and 12 minutes, customers were unable to update existing chat, portal or email cases. Customers who attempted to create a support case were presented with our backup contact method and were able to receive support through this method which remained available throughout the outage.\n## Root Cause\nThe outage was triggered by a vendor-initiated change that impacted the performance of our support ticket persistence layer. This update inadvertently caused unavailability, specifically to the query subsystem of our support case management tool. After this configuration change was applied, the subsystem became unresponsive, preventing the processing of any read or write commands. As a result, customers and Google Support were unable to access or update support ticket data, leading to service disruption.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nOur monitoring systems detected elevated error rates and, at 22:09 US/Pacific, alerted our engineering team, who immediately started an investigation with the vendor. The vendor's incident team concluded that the query subsystem state would not be resolved by a configuration rollback. The vendor’s engineering team prepared a new update, validated it in a test environment, and applied the update to production, returning the system to service on 15 November 2024 at 04:09 US/Pacific.\nWe are taking immediate steps with the vendor to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n- A production change freeze for the vendor's query subsystem is in place until rollout safeguards are sufficient to prevent further impact.\n- We are working with the vendor to improve their change management process to ensure safer rollouts that avoid unexpected issues while also providing earlier detection of rollout change.\n- We will perform a review of rollback safety for configuration changes with the vendor to ensure rollback is always possible, reducing recovery time.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting on 14 November 2024 at 21:57 US/Pacific,\n- Customers observed increased latency and required multiple attempts when opening support cases. Customers were able to use the backup case creation process to receive support.\n- Customers were able to send and receive updates to existing support cases by email, but were not able to update cases using the support portal. Support agents were able to send update emails for cases, create pro-active bugs and fill Contact-Us-Forms (CUFs) on behalf of their customers. However, responding via the support portal was unavailable.\n- Customers with active chat support cases were unable to continue their conversation. Error messages received by customers included options for continuing support via the Contact-Us-Forms (CUFs).\n- All contractual obligations for support requests submitted through the Contact-Us-Forms (CUFs) were fulfilled.",

The impacted network paths were recovered post reboot and connectivity was restored at 16:43 US/Pacific.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platforms’ performance and resilience.\n## Impact\nGCP operates multiple PoPs in the australia-southeast2 region to connect Cloud zones to each other and to Google’s Global Network. Google maintains sufficient capacity to ensure that occasional failures of network capacity are not noticeable and/or have minimal disruption to customers.\nOn Tuesday, 29 October 2024, two fiber failures had occurred near this region. These failures reduced the available inter-region network capacity, but did not impact the availability of GCP services in the region.\nThen later that same day, the PoP where 50% of the network capacity for the region is hosted, experienced a power voltage swell event causing the networking devices in the PoP to reboot. When the networking devices in this datacenter rebooted, this networking capacity was temporarily unavailable.\nThis rare triple failure resulted in reduced connectivity across zones in the region and caused multiple Google Cloud services to lose connectivity for 21 minutes. Additionally, customers using Zones A and Zones C, experienced up to 15% increased latency and error rates for 16 minutes due to degraded inter-zone network connectivity while the networking devices recovered from the reboot .\nGoogle engineers were already working on remediating the two fiber failures when they were alerted to the network disruption caused by the voltage swell via an internal monitoring alert on Tuesday, 29 October 2024 16:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nAfter the devices had completed rebooting, the impacted network paths were recovered and all affected Cloud Zones regained full connectivity to the network at 16:43 US/Pacific.\nMajority of GCP services impacted by the issue recovered shortly thereafter. A few Cloud services experienced longer restoration times as manual actions were required in some cases to complete full recovery.\n**(Updated on 04 December 2024\\)**\n## Root cause of device reboots\nUpon review of the power management systems, Google engineers have determined there is a mismatch in voltage tolerances in the affected network equipment on the site. The affected network racks are currently designed to tolerate up to \\~110% of designed voltage, but the UPS which supplies the power to the network equipment is designed to tolerate up to \\~120% of designed voltage.\nThe voltage swell event caused a deviation between 110% and 120% which was detected by the networking equipment's rectifiers as outside their allowable range and they powered down in order to protect the equipment.\nWe have determined that a voltage regulator for the datacenter-level UPS was enabled, which is a standard setting. This caused an additional boost during power fluctuations, pushing the voltage into the problematic 110%-120% range. The voltage regulator is necessary to ensure sufficient voltage when loads are high, but because the equipment is well below its load limit, and caused a deviation above expected levels.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe are taking the following actions to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n* Review our datacenter power distribution design in the region and implement any recommended additional protections for critical networking devices against voltage swells and sags.\n* As an initial risk reduction measure, the datacenter-level UPS voltage regulator will be reconfigured, and we have instituted monthly reviews to ensure it will be configured to correctly match future site load.\n* We are also deploying a double conversion UPS in the affected datacenter's power distribution design for the equipment that failed during this event.\n* Implement changes to network device configuration that reduce time to recover full network connectivity after a failure.\n* Review and verify that this risk does not exist in other locations, and if so proactively perform the above remediations.\n* Root cause and determine corrective actions for GCP Services that did not recover quickly from the incident after the network connectivity was restored.\n----\nTo summarize, the root cause investigation for the network device reboots impacting the australia-southeast2 region has been concluded. Google teams are implementing additional preventative measures to minimize the risk of recurrence.\nThis is the final version of the Incident Report.\n----",

Beginning 06:45 US/Pacific Cloud Build started processing the requests in the us-central1 region, however experienced significant execution delays for a duration of 2 hours and 2 minutes. To our Google Cloud customers who were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Build uses an internal component that manages the execution of the builds by using transient worker Google Compute Engine (GCE) virtual machine (VM) instances. Each machine is only used for execution of one build and deleted after that.\nThe root cause of the issue is Cloud Build's failure to degrade gracefully upon being throttled by its GCE API quota in the us-central1 region. As a result of being throttled, the Cloud Build component responsible for managing worker pools initiated multiple retries due to an incorrect configuration, further exacerbating the quota exhaustion and completely preventing the creation of new worker instances in the region. This effectively halted build processing in the us-central1 region, leading to a regional outage.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage from an internal monitoring alert at 02:31 US/Pacific on Friday 25 October, 2024 and immediately started an investigation.\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers tuned retry settings by 06:40 US/Pacific to bring calls to the GCE API to sustainable levels. This ensured the requests were no longer throttled and the internal system was able to create worker VM instances again to execute new builds and process the backlog. Subsequently at 08:47 the backlog queue dropped to normal levels.\nGoogle engineers proactively increased the quota at 09:43 US/Pacific to ensure this incident does not immediately reoccur.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- We are improving the mechanism which Cloud Build creates and deletes GCE worker VMs to ensure graceful degradation of service in case of errors.\n- We are conducting a thorough investigation of internal quotas in all regions to ensure that we have enough capacity to execute builds from all customers at peak traffic.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Cloud Build\nDuring the period of impact, customers’ would have noticed that all the builds (both created manually and scheduled by build triggers) in the us-central1 region were being queued but not executed, and appeared as stuck.\nOnce the incident was resolved, all builds that had exceeded the amount of time they could be queued got marked as expired. The remaining ones were eventually executed but with a delay.\n### Google Cloud Deploy\nCustomers were able to create new releases and rollouts (whether initiated manually or through automation), however the resources became stuck in an 'in-progress' state. Essentially, the Cloud Deploy service was not operational in the us-central1 region, as no deployments were being executed.\n### Google App Engine (GAE)\nGAE version deployments in the us-central1 region saw elevated latency in its execution or failed with an “INTERNAL” error. Request traffic to existing GAE versions was not impacted by this incident.\n### Google Cloud functions\nCustomers would have seen elevated “RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED” errors or elevated latency for the create and update operations in the us-central1 region for Cloud Run functions. Request traffic to existing Cloud Run functions (1st and 2nd Gen) was not impacted by this incident.\n### Google Cloud Run\nA few customers deploying source code to Cloud Run in the us-central1 region experienced increased deployment latency of deployment failures with an “INTERNAL” error.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 25 October, 2024 02:15\n**Incident End:** 25 October, 2024 08:03\n**Duration:** 5 hours, 48 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n* Cloud Build\n* Cloud Deploy\n**Regions/Zones:** us-central1\n**Description:**\nCloud Build and Cloud Deploy customers in the us-central1 region experienced a service disruption lasting 5 hours and 48 minutes. During this time, 100% of builds were either stuck in the queued phase and subsequently expired, or faced significant execution delays. The root cause was identified as a bug in how Cloud Build interacts with Google Compute Engine (GCE) to provision compute resources. Due to organic traffic growth, Cloud Build exceeded its GCE quota, triggering a retry-storm instead of graceful degradation. This prevented the creation of new worker instances, leading to a regional outage as existing builds could not be processed.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Cloud Build: During the incident, builds were queued for execution but not actually executed and would have appeared as stuck. That applied both to builds created manually and via triggers. Upon this incident’s resolution, most of the builds would have exceeded the amount of time the build can be queued and were marked as expired. These builds will not be executed any more and must be re-created.\n* Google Cloud Deploy: New releases and rollouts (whether initiated manually or through automation) could be created, but the resources became stuck in an 'in-progress' state.

Each machine is only used for execution of one build and deleted after that.\nThe root cause of the issue is Cloud Build's failure to degrade gracefully upon being throttled by its GCE API quota in the us-central1 region. As a result of being throttled, the Cloud Build component responsible for managing worker pools initiated multiple retries due to an incorrect configuration, further exacerbating the quota exhaustion and completely preventing the creation of new worker instances in the region. This effectively halted build processing in the us-central1 region, leading to a regional outage.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage from an internal monitoring alert at 02:31 US/Pacific on Friday 25 October, 2024 and immediately started an investigation.\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers tuned retry settings by 06:40 US/Pacific to bring calls to the GCE API to sustainable levels. This ensured the requests were no longer throttled and the internal system was able to create worker VM instances again to execute new builds and process the backlog. Subsequently at 08:47 the backlog queue dropped to normal levels.\nGoogle engineers proactively increased the quota at 09:43 US/Pacific to ensure this incident does not immediately reoccur.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- We are improving the mechanism which Cloud Build creates and deletes GCE worker VMs to ensure graceful degradation of service in case of errors.\n- We are conducting a thorough investigation of internal quotas in all regions to ensure that we have enough capacity to execute builds from all customers at peak traffic.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Cloud Build\nDuring the period of impact, customers’ would have noticed that all the builds (both created manually and scheduled by build triggers) in the us-central1 region were being queued but not executed, and appeared as stuck.\nOnce the incident was resolved, all builds that had exceeded the amount of time they could be queued got marked as expired. The remaining ones were eventually executed but with a delay.\n### Google Cloud Deploy\nCustomers were able to create new releases and rollouts (whether initiated manually or through automation), however the resources became stuck in an 'in-progress' state. Essentially, the Cloud Deploy service was not operational in the us-central1 region, as no deployments were being executed.\n### Google App Engine (GAE)\nGAE version deployments in the us-central1 region saw elevated latency in its execution or failed with an “INTERNAL” error. Request traffic to existing GAE versions was not impacted by this incident.\n### Google Cloud functions\nCustomers would have seen elevated “RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED” errors or elevated latency for the create and update operations in the us-central1 region for Cloud Run functions. Request traffic to existing Cloud Run functions (1st and 2nd Gen) was not impacted by this incident.\n### Google Cloud Run\nA few customers deploying source code to Cloud Run in the us-central1 region experienced increased deployment latency of deployment failures with an “INTERNAL” error.",

        "text": "## **Incident Report**\n## **Summary**\nOn Wednesday, 23 October 2024, a power failure occurred in a single data center within the europe-west3 region. This failure degraded the building’s cooling infrastructure, leading to a partial shutdown of the europe-west-c zone to avoid thermal damage and causing Virtual Machines (VMs) to go offline. The event duration was 7 hours and 39 minutes and impacted various Google Cloud services in the affected zone.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and resilience.\n##\n## **Root Cause**\nOn 23 October 2024, at 18:22 US/Pacific time, an electrical arc flash occurred in one of the europe-west3-c zone's power distribution units, resulting in a partial power outage. This incident also affected the cooling infrastructure, leading to a rise in ambient temperature. To prevent damage, some IT equipment at the facility was shut down, causing Virtual Machines (VMs) in the datacenter to go offline and impacting multiple cloud services in the zone.\n##\n## **Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to VM failures in europe-west3-c zone at 18:39 US/Pacific on 23 October 2024, and immediately launched an investigation. Upon understanding the issue's nature and scope, engineers took precautionary measures to ensure equipment safety by shutting it down and diverting traffic away from the affected infrastructure at 20:43 US/Pacific. Power was manually restored at 21:44 US/Pacific by transferring the load away from the failed components. Cloud traffic was gradually reintroduced to the datacenter at 00:30 US/Pacific on 24 October, 2024\\. Full restoration of all cloud services in the affected zone was completed by 2:09 US/Pacific.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future. To ensure continued high availability in the future, Google are pursuing the following actions:\n* Complete root cause investigation on the arc flash and complete repairs of the affected power distribution unit.\n* Ensure that the underlying root cause(s) of the arc flash are not present in any other data centers, and remediating any risks which are discovered in the analysis of the event.\n* Further hardening GCP’s Persistent Disk services to prevent any regional impact during single-zone issues. This work is anticipated to be fully rolled out in the coming weeks.\n## **Detailed Description of Impact**\n**Google Compute Engine (GCE) and Persistent Disk (PD):**\nCustomers experienced increased latency and errors when creating new GCE instances and attaching Persistent Disk volumes to existing instances in all europe-west3 zones from 23 October 2024 19:12 to 23:34 US/Pacific. The elevated error rates resulted from problems in access control services for multiple zones that were caused by a misconfiguration and triggered by the outage in europe-west3-c. To prevent a recurrence of this issue, engineers have hardened this component against zonal outages in europe-west3.\nAdditionally, a small percentage of Persistent Disk volumes in europe-west3-c were unavailable from 23 October 2024 18:24 to 24 October 2024 00:58 US/Pacific.\n**Google Cloud Pub/Sub:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls from 23 October 2024 18:25 to 18:41 US/Pacific and elevated latency for push subscriptions from 23 October 2024 22:57 to 24 October 2024 00:11 US/Pacific in europe-west3-c.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced higher latencies for both batch and streaming jobs from 23 October 2024 19:05 to 23:55 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Dataproc:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in all API calls from 23 October 2024 19:12 to 22:00 US/Pacific in europe-west3 and a few customers might have experienced errors in all API calls except the create cluster API call through 24 October 2024 23:47 US/Pacific.\n**Cloud Build:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls from 23 October 2024 20:52 to 24 October 2024 01:11 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):**\nDuring the period of the outage, a small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls to europe-west3. A small percentage of customers may have additionally experienced unavailability of their Kubernetes Control Planes in europe-west3 or europe-west3-c and/or Kubernetes nodes in europe-west3-c.\n**Vertex AI Batch Prediction:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in batch prediction jobs from 23 October 2024 19:45 to 23:30 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Cloud SQL:**\nCustomers creating or updating instances in europe-west3 may have experienced errors from 23 October 2024 18:35 US/Pacific to 24 October 2024 23:28 US/Pacific. Users with self-service or scheduled maintenance on instances in europe-west3 during this period may have experienced a failed update causing downtime.\n----------",

      "text": "## **Incident Report**\n## **Summary**\nOn Wednesday, 23 October 2024, a power failure occurred in a single data center within the europe-west3 region. This failure degraded the building’s cooling infrastructure, leading to a partial shutdown of the europe-west-c zone to avoid thermal damage and causing Virtual Machines (VMs) to go offline. The event duration was 7 hours and 39 minutes and impacted various Google Cloud services in the affected zone.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and resilience.\n##\n## **Root Cause**\nOn 23 October 2024, at 18:22 US/Pacific time, an electrical arc flash occurred in one of the europe-west3-c zone's power distribution units, resulting in a partial power outage. This incident also affected the cooling infrastructure, leading to a rise in ambient temperature. To prevent damage, some IT equipment at the facility was shut down, causing Virtual Machines (VMs) in the datacenter to go offline and impacting multiple cloud services in the zone.\n##\n## **Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to VM failures in europe-west3-c zone at 18:39 US/Pacific on 23 October 2024, and immediately launched an investigation. Upon understanding the issue's nature and scope, engineers took precautionary measures to ensure equipment safety by shutting it down and diverting traffic away from the affected infrastructure at 20:43 US/Pacific. Power was manually restored at 21:44 US/Pacific by transferring the load away from the failed components. Cloud traffic was gradually reintroduced to the datacenter at 00:30 US/Pacific on 24 October, 2024\\. Full restoration of all cloud services in the affected zone was completed by 2:09 US/Pacific.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future. To ensure continued high availability in the future, Google are pursuing the following actions:\n* Complete root cause investigation on the arc flash and complete repairs of the affected power distribution unit.\n* Ensure that the underlying root cause(s) of the arc flash are not present in any other data centers, and remediating any risks which are discovered in the analysis of the event.\n* Further hardening GCP’s Persistent Disk services to prevent any regional impact during single-zone issues. This work is anticipated to be fully rolled out in the coming weeks.\n## **Detailed Description of Impact**\n**Google Compute Engine (GCE) and Persistent Disk (PD):**\nCustomers experienced increased latency and errors when creating new GCE instances and attaching Persistent Disk volumes to existing instances in all europe-west3 zones from 23 October 2024 19:12 to 23:34 US/Pacific. The elevated error rates resulted from problems in access control services for multiple zones that were caused by a misconfiguration and triggered by the outage in europe-west3-c. To prevent a recurrence of this issue, engineers have hardened this component against zonal outages in europe-west3.\nAdditionally, a small percentage of Persistent Disk volumes in europe-west3-c were unavailable from 23 October 2024 18:24 to 24 October 2024 00:58 US/Pacific.\n**Google Cloud Pub/Sub:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls from 23 October 2024 18:25 to 18:41 US/Pacific and elevated latency for push subscriptions from 23 October 2024 22:57 to 24 October 2024 00:11 US/Pacific in europe-west3-c.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced higher latencies for both batch and streaming jobs from 23 October 2024 19:05 to 23:55 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Dataproc:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in all API calls from 23 October 2024 19:12 to 22:00 US/Pacific in europe-west3 and a few customers might have experienced errors in all API calls except the create cluster API call through 24 October 2024 23:47 US/Pacific.\n**Cloud Build:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls from 23 October 2024 20:52 to 24 October 2024 01:11 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):**\nDuring the period of the outage, a small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls to europe-west3. A small percentage of customers may have additionally experienced unavailability of their Kubernetes Control Planes in europe-west3 or europe-west3-c and/or Kubernetes nodes in europe-west3-c.\n**Vertex AI Batch Prediction:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in batch prediction jobs from 23 October 2024 19:45 to 23:30 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Cloud SQL:**\nCustomers creating or updating instances in europe-west3 may have experienced errors from 23 October 2024 18:35 US/Pacific to 24 October 2024 23:28 US/Pacific. Users with self-service or scheduled maintenance on instances in europe-west3 during this period may have experienced a failed update causing downtime.\n----------",

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nA mismatch in configuration between two components of Google’s internal cluster management system resulted in a failure of the cluster service discovery component. This failure was triggered by a software rollout within the cluster management system that was believed to be non-impactful to operating jobs. The service discovery component is a fundamental dependency of the cluster management system, and its failure resulted in failures of other infrastructure services hosted in the cluster. Those failures resulted in downstream impacts for various Google Cloud services which are dependent on the cluster management system.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nOnce the mechanism of the fault in the internal lookup and task addressing system was identified, remediation was performed by correcting a file path, allowing the system to restart successfully. The cluster management and other downstream systems recovered once this system was back in operation.\nThe rollout of the portion of the cluster management system that triggered the outage has been paused, and the specific trigger will be remediated before rollouts of that system resume. Additionally, an update to the lookup and task addressing system is being applied to prevent recurrence even if the problematic cluster management software is rolled out again.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 15 October, 2024 23:05 to 16 October, 2024 02:49 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud products became unavailable in the us-west2-a zone / us-west2 region for a duration of 3 hours, 44 minutes.\n### Artifact Registry\nAsynchronous API operations to create new repositories saw an increased failure rate.\n### Cloud Build\nIncreased errors in CreateBuild calls (up to 7% at peak), builds delayed for 2 hours, builds with shorter TTLs expired.\n### Google Cloud Deploy\nRender, predeploy, deploy, verify, and postdeploy operations in us-west2 were unable to complete.\n### Google Cloud Dataflow\nCustomers experienced latency (slowness) while running both batch and streaming jobs.\n### Google Cloud Bigtable\nSome resources in us-west2-a experienced an increase in CANCELED and UNAVAILABLE errors.\n### Google Cloud SQL\nSome instance creation and backup operations failed.\n### Cloud Interconnect\nCloud Interconnect attachments to us-west2 could not be created, updated, or deleted.\n### Virtual Private Cloud\nProgramming of new VMs from other regions was not reaching the impacted zone. This also resulted in cross region packet loss.\n### Cloud Identity and Access Management\nReplication Delay of Sessions, Service Accounts, and other resources to the impacted zone\n### Persistent Disk\nSnapshots intermittently failed in this zone.\n### Compute Engine\nSome VMs in us-west2-a were unavailable; customers were unable to connect to them, modify them, or delete them. New VM creations in the zone were working and those VMs remained healthy.",

Its failure led to the unavailability of our internal cluster management system in the affected zone, impacting Google Cloud services dependent on it.\nGoogle Engineers implemented a fix to return the lookup and task addressing system to full operation and this mitigated the issue.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* ***Artifact Registry :*** Asynchronous API operations to create new repositories saw an increased failure rate.\n* ***Cloud Build :*** Increased errors in CreateBuild calls (up to 7% at peak), builds delayed for 2 hours, builds with shorter TTLs expired.\n* ***Google Cloud Deploy :*** Render, predeploy, deploy, verify, and postdeploy operations in us-west2 were unable to complete.\n* ***Google Cloud Dataflow :*** Customers experienced latency (slowness) while running both batch and streaming jobs.\n* ***Google Cloud Bigtable :*** Clusters in us-west2-a experienced an increase in CANCELED and UNAVAILABLE errors and admin operations were failing.\n* ***Google Cloud SQL :*** Some instance creation and backup operations failed.\n* ***Cloud Interconnect :*** Cloud Interconnect attachments to us-west2 could not be created, updated, or deleted.\n* ***Virtual Private Cloud :*** Programming of new VMs from other regions was not reaching the impacted zone.

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 16 October 2024, multiple Google Cloud products became unavailable in the us-west2-a zone / us-west2 region for a duration of 3 hours.\nTo our affected customers whose business was impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nA mismatch in configuration between two components of Google’s internal cluster management system resulted in a failure of the cluster service discovery component. This failure was triggered by a software rollout within the cluster management system that was believed to be non-impactful to operating jobs. The service discovery component is a fundamental dependency of the cluster management system, and its failure resulted in failures of other infrastructure services hosted in the cluster. Those failures resulted in downstream impacts for various Google Cloud services which are dependent on the cluster management system.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nOnce the mechanism of the fault in the internal lookup and task addressing system was identified, remediation was performed by correcting a file path, allowing the system to restart successfully. The cluster management and other downstream systems recovered once this system was back in operation.\nThe rollout of the portion of the cluster management system that triggered the outage has been paused, and the specific trigger will be remediated before rollouts of that system resume. Additionally, an update to the lookup and task addressing system is being applied to prevent recurrence even if the problematic cluster management software is rolled out again.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 15 October, 2024 23:05 to 16 October, 2024 02:49 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud products became unavailable in the us-west2-a zone / us-west2 region for a duration of 3 hours, 44 minutes.\n### Artifact Registry\nAsynchronous API operations to create new repositories saw an increased failure rate.\n### Cloud Build\nIncreased errors in CreateBuild calls (up to 7% at peak), builds delayed for 2 hours, builds with shorter TTLs expired.\n### Google Cloud Deploy\nRender, predeploy, deploy, verify, and postdeploy operations in us-west2 were unable to complete.\n### Google Cloud Dataflow\nCustomers experienced latency (slowness) while running both batch and streaming jobs.\n### Google Cloud Bigtable\nSome resources in us-west2-a experienced an increase in CANCELED and UNAVAILABLE errors.\n### Google Cloud SQL\nSome instance creation and backup operations failed.\n### Cloud Interconnect\nCloud Interconnect attachments to us-west2 could not be created, updated, or deleted.\n### Virtual Private Cloud\nProgramming of new VMs from other regions was not reaching the impacted zone. This also resulted in cross region packet loss.\n### Cloud Identity and Access Management\nReplication Delay of Sessions, Service Accounts, and other resources to the impacted zone\n### Persistent Disk\nSnapshots intermittently failed in this zone.\n### Compute Engine\nSome VMs in us-west2-a were unavailable; customers were unable to connect to them, modify them, or delete them. New VM creations in the zone were working and those VMs remained healthy.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 2 October 2024, Google Cloud and Google Workspace Support experienced intermittent issues with case creation for 2 hours, 5 minutes, between 14:18 US/Pacific to 16:23 US/Pacific. As a result, some users encountered unexpected errors and slight delays in case creation due to this system disruption. Additionally, the backup case creation process (through the UI) experienced elevated latency. To our Google Cloud and Google Workspace customers who experienced delay in case creation during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Support’s ticket persistence layer has a capacity management system in its control plane to ensure availability. Google services that integrate with the ticket persistence layer are expected to perform a controlled ramp of traffic and respond to backpressure signals. If an integration continues sending additional load after backpressure signals, the capacity management system applies a temporary throttle to the specific integration to ensure the health of the system.\nBeginning at 14:18 on Wednesday, 02 October 2024, an existing internal Google reporting service that integrates with the ticket persistence layer responded to an increase in data volume by rapidly ramping traffic. Due to a latent issue in the reporting service, it sent traffic in a way that bypassed normal backpressure signals. Over time traffic from the reporting service reached an elevated level to cause high query latency for some operations in our support UI. Once load on the persistence layer exceeded pre-set limits, the capacity management system restored service by temporarily throttling the reporting service’s traffic. Due to a latent issue in the reporting service, when the temporary throttle expired the reporting service again rapidly ramped traffic until the capacity management system again applied a temporary throttle.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nAs each impact period was short, internal monitoring metrics for the support UI did not reach alarm thresholds until 15:01. Once these thresholds were met, Google engineers were alerted to the incident at 15:01 and immediately started working on the issue.\nAfter thorough analysis, our engineering team identified the source of the traffic to the ticket persistence layer and applied a long-lived throttle, restoring service.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* We are revising our monitoring to detect customer impact earlier.\n* We are revising the method used to integrate with the ticket persistence layer to perform a controlled ramp of traffic as well as improve detection and response to backpressure signals. This will ensure all integrations manage resources better, reducing dependency on capacity management failsafes.\n* We are updating our ticket persistence layer to apply traffic isolation and load shedding best practices so that traffic for customer support cases cannot be affected by traffic from internal reporting systems.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nBetween 14:18 US/Pacific to 16:23 US/Pacific on Wednesday 02, October 2024, users experienced intermittent delays in case creation (up to a minute). <5% of users who attempted to create a support case saw an error message “Unable to create case. Try again.” Almost all users who re-attempted creation succeeded. A small number of users experienced three consecutive failures and were presented with an alternate support contact form.\nAll customers were able to receive support during this time for existing cases.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 2 Oct 2024 14:18\n**Incident End:** 2 Oct 2024 16:23\n**Duration:** 2 hours, 5 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Support and Google Workspace Support\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nFor 2 hours and 5 minutes, Google Cloud Support and Google Workspace Support customers attempting to create cases experienced intermittent case creation delays, each lasting less than 5 minutes. During the period of impact, the case creation UI directed customers experiencing the longest delays to create their case using a backup system. We have not received any reports of customers being unable to contact Support during the impacted period.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was the scaling behavior of a routine data pipeline. The data pipeline ramped use of a common persistence layer in a manner that bypassed normal load shedding and isolation. When the persistence layer became unhealthy, the control plane applied a temporary throttle to the data pipeline, enabling the Support UI to successfully create user cases, until the temporary throttle expired, at which time the pipeline repeated its behavior.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Users faced intermittent delays when attempting to create cases, with a few seeing errors.",

From 11:23 to 12:28 US/ Pacific (1 hour and 5 minutes), customers were unable to login and were redirected to a maintenance page containing a notice of the outage while engineers fixed the issue.\nTo our Mandiant Security Validation SaaS customers whose business was impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThis issue occurred due to an implementation issue in a backend database that limited a sequence column value. The value was incremented beyond that limit causing the database and system to encounter an error which prevented users from running Actions, Sequence and Evaluations.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via a support case on 25 September 2024 at 01:41 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers adjusted the column value limit that was causing the issue. This required taking Mandiant Security Validation SaaS briefly offline to perform the necessary changes needed to resolve the issue and prevent it from recurring in the future. During this time users were redirected to a maintenance page informing them of the outage. Once the system was brought back online, engineers verified the underlying issue was resolved and that no further issues were encountered.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing a :\n* Thorough review of the system settings to ensure no further limitations exist that would cause this or similar issues to occur.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n* From 1:27 to 11:22 US/ Pacific, customers were able to login and view the UI, but were unable to create and run content (Actions/Evaluations/Sequences).\n* From 11:23 to 12:28 US/ Pacific, customers were redirected to a maintenance page containing a notice of the outage.",

In some regions, customers experienced a complete service outage for a period between 5 minutes and 67 minutes. Issue began on 18 September 2024 at 12:34 US/Pacific and was completely resolved on 18 September 2024 at 15:30 US/Pacific.\nTo our customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was a newly implemented automation code which created a bad traffic routing policy. This policy incorrectly directed our traffic routing control plane to mark all clusters as being unavailable to serve traffic for App Engine, Google Cloud Run functions (1st gen)* and dependent services. Google engineers intervened before the policy was rolled out to all clusters, resulting in a partial outage of the service.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via internal production monitoring on 18 September 2024 at 13:01 US/Pacific shortly after customers began experiencing the impact. Engineering teams have identified the automation which caused the impact and terminated it at 13:46. However customer impact was only mitigated at 15:30 post manually directing the traffic back to the affected clusters.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of the issue in the future and is completing the following actions: - We have removed the automation which caused the outage as a short term measure - We are working to implement a more efficient and well tested traffic routing maintenance process - We will implement safeguards in the automation pipeline to prevent recurrence of this issue\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Wednesday 18 September, 2024 from 12:34 US/Pacific to 15:30 US/Pacific, Google App Engine, Google Cloud Run Functions (1st gen)* and Cloud Firestore experienced elevated error rates and increased latency. Customers reported 5xx errors with the message “Request was aborted after waiting too long to attempt to service your request.” and high latency. Customers also experienced high cold starts during this time.\nIn 13 regions, customers experienced a complete service outage for a period between 5 minutes and 67 minutes.\n1. asia-east2\n2. asia-northeast2\n3. asia-northeast3\n4. asia-south1\n5. asia-southeast1\n6. asia-southeast2\n7. europe-west2\n8. europe-west3\n9. europe-west6\n10. northamerica-northeast1\n11. southamerica-east1\n12. us-central2\n13. us-west1\nIn other 11 regions, customers might observe elevated error rates:\n1. asia-east1\n2. asia-northeast1\n3. australia-southeast1\n4. europe-central2\n5. europe-west1\n6. us-central1\n7. us-east1\n8. us-east4\n9. us-west2\n10. us-west3\n11. us-west4\n*Cloud Run and Cloud Run functions (gen2) were not affected.",

Based on our preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was identified as a newly implemented automation code which created a bad traffic routing policy. This policy incorrectly directed our traffic routing control plane to mark all clusters as being unavailable to serve traffic for App Engine and dependent services. Google engineers intervened before the policy was rolled out to all clusters, resulting in a partial outage of the service.\nGoogle engineers have identified the automation that was responsible for this change and have terminated it until appropriate safeguards are put in place. The impact was mitigated by manually directing the traffic back to the affected clusters. There is no risk of a recurrence of this outage at the moment.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact**\n* Customers experienced elevated latency and error rates for Google App Engine, Google Cloud Functions Gen1 and Firestore services.\n* Customers in some regions experienced a complete service outage for Google App Engine, Google Cloud Functions Gen1 and Firestore services.\n----",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 18 September, 2024, Google App Engine, Cloud Firestore, and Google Cloud Run functions (1st gen) experienced increased latency and error rates for a duration of 2 hours and 56 minutes in multiple regions. In some regions, customers experienced a complete service outage for a period between 5 minutes and 67 minutes. Issue began on 18 September 2024 at 12:34 US/Pacific and was completely resolved on 18 September 2024 at 15:30 US/Pacific.\nTo our customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was a newly implemented automation code which created a bad traffic routing policy. This policy incorrectly directed our traffic routing control plane to mark all clusters as being unavailable to serve traffic for App Engine, Google Cloud Run functions (1st gen)* and dependent services. Google engineers intervened before the policy was rolled out to all clusters, resulting in a partial outage of the service.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via internal production monitoring on 18 September 2024 at 13:01 US/Pacific shortly after customers began experiencing the impact. Engineering teams have identified the automation which caused the impact and terminated it at 13:46. However customer impact was only mitigated at 15:30 post manually directing the traffic back to the affected clusters.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of the issue in the future and is completing the following actions: - We have removed the automation which caused the outage as a short term measure - We are working to implement a more efficient and well tested traffic routing maintenance process - We will implement safeguards in the automation pipeline to prevent recurrence of this issue\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Wednesday 18 September, 2024 from 12:34 US/Pacific to 15:30 US/Pacific, Google App Engine, Google Cloud Run Functions (1st gen)* and Cloud Firestore experienced elevated error rates and increased latency. Customers reported 5xx errors with the message “Request was aborted after waiting too long to attempt to service your request.” and high latency. Customers also experienced high cold starts during this time.\nIn 13 regions, customers experienced a complete service outage for a period between 5 minutes and 67 minutes.\n1. asia-east2\n2. asia-northeast2\n3. asia-northeast3\n4. asia-south1\n5. asia-southeast1\n6. asia-southeast2\n7. europe-west2\n8. europe-west3\n9. europe-west6\n10. northamerica-northeast1\n11. southamerica-east1\n12. us-central2\n13. us-west1\nIn other 11 regions, customers might observe elevated error rates:\n1. asia-east1\n2. asia-northeast1\n3. australia-southeast1\n4. europe-central2\n5. europe-west1\n6. us-central1\n7. us-east1\n8. us-east4\n9. us-west2\n10. us-west3\n11. us-west4\n*Cloud Run and Cloud Run functions (gen2) were not affected.",

The list of impacted products and services is detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nMost Google Cloud products and services use a regional metadata store to support their internal operations. The metadata store supports critical functions such as servicing customer requests, load balancing, admin operations, and retrieving/storing metadata including server location information.\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) internal DNS depends on the regional metadata store for storing instance metadata. A routine update of the metadata store to a new software version had a change which resulted in poor handling of a rare resource contention corner case, which caused the writes from GCE internal DNS to a zonal replica of the metadata store to fail.\nDuring such zonal issues, we have automated failover mechanisms to use the healthy replicas from other zones. But during this disruption, a secondary issue caused automated failover to not work, rendering the entire metadata storage unavailable despite two other healthy zones being available.\nThis resulted in disruptions to all GCE instance operations in the asia-northeast1 region. Actions such as creating, deleting, starting, and stopping instances or consuming reservations were affected. This, in turn, affected operations of other services dependent on GCE instances, including GKE, Cloud Build, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Deploy and Cloud SQL.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by internal monitoring on 7 September 2024 at 04:26 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. The issue was fully mitigated at 06:10 US/Pacific after failover of the metadata storage operations to the healthy zones was manually initiated by our engineering team.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Improve the automated failover logic used in the metadata storage infrastructure.\n* Improve the testing of how the metadata storage service handles resource contention corner cases.\n* Improve internal processes and documentations to enable faster response and mitigation time for this type of issue.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n- **Google Compute Engine**\nGoogle Compute Engine requests and operations like creating, deleting, starting or modifying VMs were not executed.\n- **Cloud Build**\nCloud Build deployments via the Cloud Build API or via Cloud Build Integrations were not being executed.\n- **Cloud Dataflow**\nGoogle Cloud Dataflow jobs failed at start up, existing job autoscale functionality was disrupted.\n- **Cloud Deploy**\nGoogle Cloud Deploy actions (render, deploy, verify, pre- and post-deploy hooks) were unresponsive and unable to complete their tasks.\n- **Google Cloud SQL**\nGoogle Cloud SQL, dependent on Google Compute Engine, experienced operational issues during this incident. No database creation or deletion operations were possible during the incident.\n- **Google Kubernetes Engine**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine experienced issues with operations that depend on GCE. Specifically, cluster and node pool creation, node autoscaling, cluster and node upgrades, and automatic repairs were unsuccessful in the affected region and zones.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support (All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 4 September, 2024 08:16\n**Incident End:** 4 September, 2024 12:25\n**Duration:** 4 hours, 9 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nCloud Run, Google App Engine, Google Cloud Composer, Google Cloud Console, Google Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Marketplace, Cloud Deployment Manager\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGlobally, multiple cloud products experienced deployment failures due to the inaccessibility of Cloud Deployment Manager (CDM) services. This resulted in outages affecting all deployments and the CDM user interface within the cloud console for a duration of 4 hours and 9 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a regressive change in our rollout strategy. This change inadvertently caused all incoming requests to be discarded, resulting in widespread RPC errors for both internal systems and external customers.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCloud Composer:\nAll Composer 1 operations (creations/updates/deletions) were failing globally.\nRunning Composer 1 environments were not affected.\nAll other versions (Composer 2, Composer 3) were not affected.\nCloud Marketplace:\nCustomers experienced errors when deploying Deployment Manager based solutions on Google Cloud Marketplace.\nCloud Deployment Manager services were unreachable, caused outages for all deployments and the Deployment Manager UI in the Cloud Console.\nApp Engine Flexible:\nApp Engine Flexible experienced failures in delete flows in us-central1.\n70-100% of all delete requests failed for ~90 min. spread across when the DM was unavailable.\nServing plane was not affected.\nServerless VPC Access:\nApp Engine Standard, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run were not able to create, update or delete VPC Access Connectors globally.\nExisting connectors were not affected.\nCloud Deployment Manager:\nAll Cloud Deployment Manager operations (create/update/deletes) were failing globally\nCustomers were unable to view, update or delete the deployments via the Google Cloud Console\nAll beta functionalities of Cloud Deployment Manager (Type Providers, Actions) were failing globally.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support (All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 4 September, 2024 08:16\n**Incident End:** 4 September, 2024 12:25\n**Duration:** 4 hours, 9 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nCloud Run, Google App Engine, Google Cloud Composer, Google Cloud Console, Google Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Marketplace, Cloud Deployment Manager\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGlobally, multiple cloud products experienced deployment failures due to the inaccessibility of Cloud Deployment Manager (CDM) services. This resulted in outages affecting all deployments and the CDM user interface within the cloud console for a duration of 4 hours and 9 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a regressive change in our rollout strategy. This change inadvertently caused all incoming requests to be discarded, resulting in widespread RPC errors for both internal systems and external customers.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCloud Composer:\nAll Composer 1 operations (creations/updates/deletions) were failing globally.\nRunning Composer 1 environments were not affected.\nAll other versions (Composer 2, Composer 3) were not affected.\nCloud Marketplace:\nCustomers experienced errors when deploying Deployment Manager based solutions on Google Cloud Marketplace.\nCloud Deployment Manager services were unreachable, caused outages for all deployments and the Deployment Manager UI in the Cloud Console.\nApp Engine Flexible:\nApp Engine Flexible experienced failures in delete flows in us-central1.\n70-100% of all delete requests failed for ~90 min. spread across when the DM was unavailable.\nServing plane was not affected.\nServerless VPC Access:\nApp Engine Standard, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run were not able to create, update or delete VPC Access Connectors globally.\nExisting connectors were not affected.\nCloud Deployment Manager:\nAll Cloud Deployment Manager operations (create/update/deletes) were failing globally\nCustomers were unable to view, update or delete the deployments via the Google Cloud Console\nAll beta functionalities of Cloud Deployment Manager (Type Providers, Actions) were failing globally.",

        "text": "## Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 12 August 2024 at 06:20 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud and Google Workspace products experienced connectivity issues in europe-west2 for a duration of 40 minutes. During the time, ingress traffic to europe-west2 and egress traffic from europe-west2 experienced elevated latencies, connection timeouts, and connection failures.\n## Root Cause\nOn 12 August 2024 06:20 US/Pacific, primary and backup power feeds were both lost in a [Google Point of Presence (POP)](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations) due to a substation switchgear failure. The affected POP hosts about ⅓ of serving first-layer [Google Front Ends (GFEs)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/infrastructure/design#google-frontend-service) located in europe-west2 and some distributed networking equipment for that region. The power loss impacted the following Google products and services that depend on GFEs in that region:\n* Google Cloud APIs, Google Workspace, and other Google services like YouTube,\n* Customer-created global external application and proxy network load balancers, including Cloud CDN\nThe power loss also impacted the following Google Cloud products which depended on impacted networking equipment:\n* Customer-created regional external application, proxy network, and passthrough network load balancers in the europe-west2 region,\n* External protocol forwarding and VM external IP address connectivity for VMs in the europe-west2 region.\n* Google Cloud Interconnect connections in some LHR colocation facilities.\nImpact was limited to situations where either or both of the following was true:\n* Inbound requests or connections were routed into the europe-west2 region of Google’s network, from the Internet, and those requests or connections depended on networking equipment that was offline, or unreachable pending reconvergence.\n* Outbound responses were routed to the Internet, from the europe-west2 region of Google’s network, and those responses depended on networking equipment that was without power.\nThe power outage caused Internet routes advertised by Google to be withdrawn in networks connected to Google’s network. The withdrawn routes were automatically replaced by other Google-advertised routes that didn’t depend on impacted networking equipment. Withdrawing and replacing routes relies on the BGP protocol and its timers, so replacement route convergence is not instantaneous, and overloading in the automatically selected replacement route GFEs extended the duration of the incident.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n* Google Workspace: _Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Chat, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Meet and Google Tasks users connecting to Workspace services from the UK region and surrounding areas experienced connectivity issues as described in the next point.\n* GFE-based products and services: _Customers on the Internet experienced a spike of broken connections followed by elevated latencies or HTTP error responses when communicating with GFE-powered Google APIs and services or customer-created global external application and proxy network load balancers. At roughly 06:23 US/Pacific, Google automatically redirected connections to the nearest possible first-layer GFEs with some latency penalty. Unfortunately, some of the nearest possible first-layer GFEs were overloaded until 06:48 when Google engineers made adjustments to more efficiently distribute incoming requests among nearby first-layer GFEs. Depending on the Google API or service or the customer-created global external load balancer, elevated latencies could have persisted until about 08:30 US/Pacific. Elevated latencies also could have applied to customer-created global external load balancers that had Cloud CDN enabled.\n* Regional Google Cloud products and services: _Until replacement routes were in effect, customers on the Internet experienced connection failures to the following GCP resources in the europe-west2 region: * Regional external application, proxy network, and passthrough network load balancers. * External protocol forwarding and VM external IP addresses.\n* Google Cloud Interconnect: _Google Cloud Interconnect connections in some LHR colocation facilities (lhr-zone1-47, lhr-zone1-832, lhr-zone1-2262, lhr-zone1-4885, lhr-zone1-99051 and lhr-zone2-47) remained offline from 06:20 US/Pacific to at least 06:57 US/Pacific, when power was restored.\nAt 06:43 US/Pacific, power was restored to the impacted networking equipment. Google networking equipment was fully operational by 06:57 US/Pacific, and connectivity to GFE-based products and services, regional Google Cloud products and services, and Google Cloud Interconnect resumed shortly thereafter.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nMultiple Google engineering teams were alerted and automated recovery tooling was triggered as expected; however, manual adjustments were required to address subsequent first-layer GFE overload. Google is reviewing automation improvements in tasks that required manual intervention to reduce the duration of future power event impact. Similarly, Google is working to increase Cloud Interconnect control plane resilience and reduce mitigation time through automated reaction to isolation events.\nAdditionally Google's partner who maintains the affected facility power in LHR (London) is conducting a full root cause analysis with the switchboard manufacturer and substation owner(s) involved in supplying power, including follow up as to why stored or generated on-site emergency power did not carry loads.",

      "text": "## Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 12 August 2024 at 06:20 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud and Google Workspace products experienced connectivity issues in europe-west2 for a duration of 40 minutes. During the time, ingress traffic to europe-west2 and egress traffic from europe-west2 experienced elevated latencies, connection timeouts, and connection failures.\n## Root Cause\nOn 12 August 2024 06:20 US/Pacific, primary and backup power feeds were both lost in a [Google Point of Presence (POP)](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations) due to a substation switchgear failure. The affected POP hosts about ⅓ of serving first-layer [Google Front Ends (GFEs)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/infrastructure/design#google-frontend-service) located in europe-west2 and some distributed networking equipment for that region. The power loss impacted the following Google products and services that depend on GFEs in that region:\n* Google Cloud APIs, Google Workspace, and other Google services like YouTube,\n* Customer-created global external application and proxy network load balancers, including Cloud CDN\nThe power loss also impacted the following Google Cloud products which depended on impacted networking equipment:\n* Customer-created regional external application, proxy network, and passthrough network load balancers in the europe-west2 region,\n* External protocol forwarding and VM external IP address connectivity for VMs in the europe-west2 region.\n* Google Cloud Interconnect connections in some LHR colocation facilities.\nImpact was limited to situations where either or both of the following was true:\n* Inbound requests or connections were routed into the europe-west2 region of Google’s network, from the Internet, and those requests or connections depended on networking equipment that was offline, or unreachable pending reconvergence.\n* Outbound responses were routed to the Internet, from the europe-west2 region of Google’s network, and those responses depended on networking equipment that was without power.\nThe power outage caused Internet routes advertised by Google to be withdrawn in networks connected to Google’s network. The withdrawn routes were automatically replaced by other Google-advertised routes that didn’t depend on impacted networking equipment. Withdrawing and replacing routes relies on the BGP protocol and its timers, so replacement route convergence is not instantaneous, and overloading in the automatically selected replacement route GFEs extended the duration of the incident.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n* Google Workspace: _Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Chat, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Meet and Google Tasks users connecting to Workspace services from the UK region and surrounding areas experienced connectivity issues as described in the next point.\n* GFE-based products and services: _Customers on the Internet experienced a spike of broken connections followed by elevated latencies or HTTP error responses when communicating with GFE-powered Google APIs and services or customer-created global external application and proxy network load balancers. At roughly 06:23 US/Pacific, Google automatically redirected connections to the nearest possible first-layer GFEs with some latency penalty. Unfortunately, some of the nearest possible first-layer GFEs were overloaded until 06:48 when Google engineers made adjustments to more efficiently distribute incoming requests among nearby first-layer GFEs. Depending on the Google API or service or the customer-created global external load balancer, elevated latencies could have persisted until about 08:30 US/Pacific. Elevated latencies also could have applied to customer-created global external load balancers that had Cloud CDN enabled.\n* Regional Google Cloud products and services: _Until replacement routes were in effect, customers on the Internet experienced connection failures to the following GCP resources in the europe-west2 region: * Regional external application, proxy network, and passthrough network load balancers. * External protocol forwarding and VM external IP addresses.\n* Google Cloud Interconnect: _Google Cloud Interconnect connections in some LHR colocation facilities (lhr-zone1-47, lhr-zone1-832, lhr-zone1-2262, lhr-zone1-4885, lhr-zone1-99051 and lhr-zone2-47) remained offline from 06:20 US/Pacific to at least 06:57 US/Pacific, when power was restored.\nAt 06:43 US/Pacific, power was restored to the impacted networking equipment. Google networking equipment was fully operational by 06:57 US/Pacific, and connectivity to GFE-based products and services, regional Google Cloud products and services, and Google Cloud Interconnect resumed shortly thereafter.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nMultiple Google engineering teams were alerted and automated recovery tooling was triggered as expected; however, manual adjustments were required to address subsequent first-layer GFE overload. Google is reviewing automation improvements in tasks that required manual intervention to reduce the duration of future power event impact. Similarly, Google is working to increase Cloud Interconnect control plane resilience and reduce mitigation time through automated reaction to isolation events.\nAdditionally Google's partner who maintains the affected facility power in LHR (London) is conducting a full root cause analysis with the switchboard manufacturer and substation owner(s) involved in supplying power, including follow up as to why stored or generated on-site emergency power did not carry loads.",

These tasks and new migration can't be started during this period.\nWe will provide an update by Tuesday, 2024-07-30 10:30 US/Pacific with current details.\nDiagnosis: No current impact to the customers.\nWorkaround: None at this time.",

During this period, these operations were stuck in a pending state. To our PD customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Root Cause\nDue to a coordination error, an internal capacity reclamation process was triggered prematurely without having the necessary internal software in place. As a result, user-initiated disk deletes and related operations were blocked and remained in a pending state for an extended period. It affected approximately 85% of scopes.\nOnce the issue was resolved, the blocked operations were automatically unblocked and completed successfully.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via monitoring alert on July 26 at 9:57 US/Pacific and promptly began an investigation. Upon understanding the issue, engineers swiftly initiated a clean-up of blocked operations, to prevent the issue from affecting more disks.\nTo fully resolve the issue, engineers accelerated the deployment of the software update across remaining scopes. This allowed the stalled operations to complete gracefully, unblocking customer-initiated operations.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a recurrence of this issue and is taking the following actions:\n* **Enforce a rigorous review process:** All future internal cleanup operations will undergo a thorough review and validation process to identify and mitigate potential conflicts with other ongoing processes.\n* **Make error-handling more robust:** Improve the system's ability to detect and gracefully handle stuck operations, preventing them from blocking customer-initiated actions.\n* **Address tooling gaps for phased rollout:** All future internal internal capacity reclamation processes will be conducted in phases to minimize the impact if any unexpected issues arise.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Friday, July 26, 2024, from 9:57 to 18:11 US/Pacific, PD customers globally experienced issues with disk delete and update operations. This also affected other disk-related actions.\nSpecifically, impacted customers encountered extended delays or failures with the following operations:\n* Disk deletions\n* Virtual Machine (VM) deletions (due to pending disk deletions)\n* Managed Instance Group scale-down operations",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn July 26, 2024, Persistent Disk (PD) experienced issues with disk delete and instance delete operations for a duration of 8 hours and 14 minutes, potentially affecting customers globally. During this period, these operations were stuck in a pending state. To our PD customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Root Cause\nDue to a coordination error, an internal capacity reclamation process was triggered prematurely without having the necessary internal software in place. As a result, user-initiated disk deletes and related operations were blocked and remained in a pending state for an extended period. It affected approximately 85% of scopes.\nOnce the issue was resolved, the blocked operations were automatically unblocked and completed successfully.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via monitoring alert on July 26 at 9:57 US/Pacific and promptly began an investigation. Upon understanding the issue, engineers swiftly initiated a clean-up of blocked operations, to prevent the issue from affecting more disks.\nTo fully resolve the issue, engineers accelerated the deployment of the software update across remaining scopes. This allowed the stalled operations to complete gracefully, unblocking customer-initiated operations.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a recurrence of this issue and is taking the following actions:\n* **Enforce a rigorous review process:** All future internal cleanup operations will undergo a thorough review and validation process to identify and mitigate potential conflicts with other ongoing processes.\n* **Make error-handling more robust:** Improve the system's ability to detect and gracefully handle stuck operations, preventing them from blocking customer-initiated actions.\n* **Address tooling gaps for phased rollout:** All future internal internal capacity reclamation processes will be conducted in phases to minimize the impact if any unexpected issues arise.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Friday, July 26, 2024, from 9:57 to 18:11 US/Pacific, PD customers globally experienced issues with disk delete and update operations. This also affected other disk-related actions.\nSpecifically, impacted customers encountered extended delays or failures with the following operations:\n* Disk deletions\n* Virtual Machine (VM) deletions (due to pending disk deletions)\n* Managed Instance Group scale-down operations",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, 15 July 2024, Google Cloud Monitoring experienced elevated query errors and degraded performance in the us-central1 region for 2 hours and 6 minutes. This impacted monitoring metrics for cloud products in the region, including Cloud Spanner, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, AlloyDB and Cloud SQL.\nTo our Cloud Monitoring customers whose monitoring capabilities were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. We understand the critical role monitoring plays in maintaining your cloud environments, and this is not the level of service we strive to provide.\nWe are committed to preventing similar disruptions in the future and continuing to improve the platform's reliability and performance.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Monitoring has experienced a sudden and unexpected, inorganic increase in usage, observing a 30% increase in growth over the past 30 days. Our automation responded to the unexpected growth, which pushed services past their current scaling limits leading to out of memory crashes reducing/degrading Cloud Monitoring query capacity in the us-central1 region.\nAs a mitigation, engineers increased the memory allocation limit on affected services to increase their scaling limits and will be working with the source of the unexpected growth to try to reduce their usage back into more expected limits.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by internal monitoring on 15 July 2024 at 08:53 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nAt 10:11 US/Pacific engineers began rolling out mitigation to increase the memory allocation limit on affected services. The mitigation was completed at 10:52 US/Pacific resolving the issue.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Dynamically adjust our scaling limits to better respond to load demands using spare capacity\n* Partition the zonal query processor into multiple partitions to avoid becoming a bottleneck in times of heavy load.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday 15 July 2024, from 08:46 to 10:52 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced increased query latency and/or reduced availability in the us-central1.\n**Cloud Monitoring**\nCloud Monitoring customers experienced increased query latency and/or reduced availability for Cloud Monitoring metrics stored in the us-central1 cloud region. Queries for metrics stored in other regions, including the \"global\" region were unaffected.\n**Metrics**\nCloud Monitoring API queries e.g. via QueryTimeSeries, ListTimeSeries, or PromQL endpoints, for metrics in this region may have returned a partial or empty response. Queries fanning out to multiple regions would have returned applicable data from all other regions.\nCertain service metrics which are backed by precomputed queries in this region were unavailable during the outage window. Due to the real-time nature of precomputed queries, these gaps cannot be backfilled and will remain unavailable indefinitely.\n**Dashboards**\nCloud Console dashboards displaying metrics from this region may have data gaps and, in turn, presented a degraded experience to end users during the outage window. Dashboards displaying precomputed query-backed metrics will continue to display data gaps during this period.\n**Incidents and Alert Notifications**\nCloud Alerting policies where the location is retained and maps to the us-central1 region may have returned incorrect results which prevented alerts from firing and associated notifications being sent in a timely manner or, if short-lived, at all.\n80% of alerts in us-central1 (8% of all alerts) were dropped during the outage window, however most Cloud Alerting policies are global, not region-specific.\nCustomers may have experienced the following related to Cloud Alerting incidents and alert notifications:\n* Incident creation: Some incidents were never created, and related notifications were not sent out.\n* Incident creation: Some incidents were created up to 2 hours late; and the notifications were delayed by a similar duration.\n* Incident close: Some incidents opened prior to the outage were prematurely closed due to the absence of the alerting signal during the outage window.\n* Incident reopen: The incidents that prematurely closed as captured in #3 could reopen once the alerts started firing again - leading to double alerting for customers.\nWhen the query processing service was restored, all ad-hoc and precomputed queries, dashboards, alerts, and notifications also returned to normal operation with the exception of the data gaps noted for precomputed queries during the outage.\n**Cloud Bigtable**\nCloud Bigtable customers experienced a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics for bigtable.googleapis.com for the duration of this outage. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, Cloud Bigtable Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well. Cloud Bigtable's internal auto scaling capability was not impacted, but customers who use Google Cloud Monitoring metrics to scale their Cloud Bigtable usage would have lost metric signal and may have incorrectly scaled their instances as a result of this outage.\n**Alloy DB**\nAlloyDB customers experienced intermittently a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics from 9:00 to 10:30 PDT. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, AlloyDB Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well.There were no missing metrics after 10:30 PDT.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine customers experienced intermittently a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics from 9:00 to 10:30 PDT. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, GKE Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well.There were no missing metrics after 10:30 PDT.\nWorkload autoscaling based on external / custom metrics may not have been actuated during this period. Workload autoscaling based on cpu / memory were not affected.\n**Cloud Spanner**\nCloud Spanner customers experienced a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics for spanner.googleapis.com for the duration of this outage. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, Cloud Spanner Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well. Cloud Spanner’s native autoscaler was not impacted, but customers who use Google Cloud Monitoring metrics to scale their Cloud Spanner usage (e.g. via open source autoscalers) would have lost metric signal and may have incorrectly scaled their instances as a result of this outage.

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, 15 July 2024, Google Cloud Monitoring experienced elevated query errors and degraded performance in the us-central1 region for 2 hours and 6 minutes. This impacted monitoring metrics for cloud products in the region, including Cloud Spanner, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, AlloyDB and Cloud SQL.\nTo our Cloud Monitoring customers whose monitoring capabilities were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. We understand the critical role monitoring plays in maintaining your cloud environments, and this is not the level of service we strive to provide.\nWe are committed to preventing similar disruptions in the future and continuing to improve the platform's reliability and performance.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Monitoring has experienced a sudden and unexpected, inorganic increase in usage, observing a 30% increase in growth over the past 30 days. Our automation responded to the unexpected growth, which pushed services past their current scaling limits leading to out of memory crashes reducing/degrading Cloud Monitoring query capacity in the us-central1 region.\nAs a mitigation, engineers increased the memory allocation limit on affected services to increase their scaling limits and will be working with the source of the unexpected growth to try to reduce their usage back into more expected limits.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by internal monitoring on 15 July 2024 at 08:53 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nAt 10:11 US/Pacific engineers began rolling out mitigation to increase the memory allocation limit on affected services. The mitigation was completed at 10:52 US/Pacific resolving the issue.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Dynamically adjust our scaling limits to better respond to load demands using spare capacity\n* Partition the zonal query processor into multiple partitions to avoid becoming a bottleneck in times of heavy load.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday 15 July 2024, from 08:46 to 10:52 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced increased query latency and/or reduced availability in the us-central1.\n**Cloud Monitoring**\nCloud Monitoring customers experienced increased query latency and/or reduced availability for Cloud Monitoring metrics stored in the us-central1 cloud region. Queries for metrics stored in other regions, including the \"global\" region were unaffected.\n**Metrics**\nCloud Monitoring API queries e.g. via QueryTimeSeries, ListTimeSeries, or PromQL endpoints, for metrics in this region may have returned a partial or empty response. Queries fanning out to multiple regions would have returned applicable data from all other regions.\nCertain service metrics which are backed by precomputed queries in this region were unavailable during the outage window. Due to the real-time nature of precomputed queries, these gaps cannot be backfilled and will remain unavailable indefinitely.\n**Dashboards**\nCloud Console dashboards displaying metrics from this region may have data gaps and, in turn, presented a degraded experience to end users during the outage window. Dashboards displaying precomputed query-backed metrics will continue to display data gaps during this period.\n**Incidents and Alert Notifications**\nCloud Alerting policies where the location is retained and maps to the us-central1 region may have returned incorrect results which prevented alerts from firing and associated notifications being sent in a timely manner or, if short-lived, at all.\n80% of alerts in us-central1 (8% of all alerts) were dropped during the outage window, however most Cloud Alerting policies are global, not region-specific.\nCustomers may have experienced the following related to Cloud Alerting incidents and alert notifications:\n* Incident creation: Some incidents were never created, and related notifications were not sent out.\n* Incident creation: Some incidents were created up to 2 hours late; and the notifications were delayed by a similar duration.\n* Incident close: Some incidents opened prior to the outage were prematurely closed due to the absence of the alerting signal during the outage window.\n* Incident reopen: The incidents that prematurely closed as captured in #3 could reopen once the alerts started firing again - leading to double alerting for customers.\nWhen the query processing service was restored, all ad-hoc and precomputed queries, dashboards, alerts, and notifications also returned to normal operation with the exception of the data gaps noted for precomputed queries during the outage.\n**Cloud Bigtable**\nCloud Bigtable customers experienced a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics for bigtable.googleapis.com for the duration of this outage. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, Cloud Bigtable Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well. Cloud Bigtable's internal auto scaling capability was not impacted, but customers who use Google Cloud Monitoring metrics to scale their Cloud Bigtable usage would have lost metric signal and may have incorrectly scaled their instances as a result of this outage.\n**Alloy DB**\nAlloyDB customers experienced intermittently a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics from 9:00 to 10:30 PDT. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, AlloyDB Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well.There were no missing metrics after 10:30 PDT.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine customers experienced intermittently a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics from 9:00 to 10:30 PDT. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, GKE Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well.There were no missing metrics after 10:30 PDT.\nWorkload autoscaling based on external / custom metrics may not have been actuated during this period. Workload autoscaling based on cpu / memory were not affected.\n**Cloud Spanner**\nCloud Spanner customers experienced a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics for spanner.googleapis.com for the duration of this outage. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, Cloud Spanner Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well. Cloud Spanner’s native autoscaler was not impacted, but customers who use Google Cloud Monitoring metrics to scale their Cloud Spanner usage (e.g. via open source autoscalers) would have lost metric signal and may have incorrectly scaled their instances as a result of this outage. Data Boost customers who have set up alerts for usage may have gotten alerted as well but Data Boost billing is not impacted.\n**Cloud SQL**\nCloud SQL customers experienced missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics cloudsql.googleapis.com for the duration of this period. Some customers who set alerts based on these metrics may get incorrectly notified, but Cloud SQL operations and the database datapath were not affected by this incident. The databases all continued to operate normally.",

To our customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nBeginning 8 June 2024, a novel form of user request to the GenerateContent API triggered intermittent segmentation faults in the Vertex Serving Prediction API servers. An affected server would restart after the segfault, and load balancers would send user queries to other healthy API servers until the affected server returned to service. The user-visible outage began when the rate of segfault-triggering traffic increased and the number of API servers offline simultaneously was sufficient to affect overall serving capacity relative to load.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via internal production monitoring on 10 June 2024 at 07:35 US/Pacific. At this time there was no visible customer impact and google engineers identified the root cause of the segmentation fault and developed a fix which they started progressively rolling out. However, on 12 June 2024 at 12:06 US/Pacific, multiple services built on top of Vertex Prediction started to report user requests that were affected by this issue in production. The root cause of the issue was quickly verified to be the same issue discovered on 10 June 2024 and accelerated the in-progress rollout. The rollout completed on 12 June 2024 at 15:59 US/Pacific, fully mitigating the issue\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of the issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Ensuring early signals of server binary issues are captured in production healthiness analysis, and investigated timely.\n- Ensuring a release validation of feature changes and updates in production.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nBetween 12 June 2024 12:06 and 12 June 2024 15:59 some users in regions: us-central1, asia-southeast1, europe-west3, europe-west4, us-east1, us-west1, northamerica-northeast1, us-east4, may have experienced the following:\n**Vertex AI Online Prediction:**\n- Google Vertex AI experienced high latency and elevated 500, 502 error rates, while executing prediction tasks using Predict, RawPredict, GenerateContent, and StreamGenerateContent methods.\n- Customers may have also experienced failure in running prediction requests with “CANCELLED” errors.\n**Dialogflow CX:**\n- Dialogflow CX Generators, Generative Fallback, and ML entities experienced elevated “INTERNAL” and “DEADLINE_EXCEEDED” errors and in some cases timeouts.\n**Agent Assist:**\n- Agent Assist features including (Proactive) Generative Knowledge Assist experienced elevated error rates in LLM Summarization and topic modeling features, including Summarization baseline V2 and Summarization with custom sections (powered by generator).\n**Contact Center AI:**\n- Contact Center AI Insights features including LLM summarization and LLM topic modeling also experienced elevated error rates.",

To our customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nBeginning 8 June 2024, a novel form of user request to the GenerateContent API triggered intermittent segmentation faults in the Vertex Serving Prediction API servers. An affected server would restart after the segfault, and load balancers would send user queries to other healthy API servers until the affected server returned to service.
