From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was that Vertex Prediction Endpoints were globally marked as deleted due to faulty resource cleanup process. The service fully recovered when the Vertex Prediction Endpoints were restored.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected customers may have experienced:\n- All pre-existing Vertex models undeployed on Vertex AI Endpoints\n- Empty responses when listing the deployed models\n- Runtime exceptions and general errors on Predict and Explain requests\n- Quota failure when trying to re-deploy models",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was that Vertex Prediction Endpoints were globally marked as deleted due to faulty resource cleanup process. The service fully recovered when the Vertex Prediction Endpoints were restored.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected customers may have experienced:\n- All pre-existing Vertex models undeployed on Vertex AI Endpoints\n- Empty responses when listing the deployed models\n- Runtime exceptions and general errors on Predict and Explain requests\n- Quota failure when trying to re-deploy models",

        "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 24 May 2022 from 18:04 to 25 May 2022 10:34 Google BigQuery experienced elevated query latencies and job failures in four regions (US multiregion, europe-west1, asia-east1, and asia-east2) for a duration of 16 hours, 30 minutes. A product change roll out was identified as the root cause. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the changes. The rollback was performed in phases to prevent additional impact on the service, which caused some regions to recover earlier than others. Affected customers experienced elevated latencies or failures for QUERY, IMPORT and EXPORT jobs in BigQuery.\n**Root Cause:**\nOn 11 May 2022, BigQuery began a software rollout to improve audit logging for data that is imported from, queried, or exported to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This rollout inadvertently contained a memory leak that gradually and incrementally manifested whenever these code paths were executed. This memory leak gradually consumed memory on BigQuery’s compute nodes until they were unable to accept new work to execute jobs, including queries, loads, and exports. The software rollout was deployed to all regions before the issue was detected and rolled back. Given the nature of the root cause, significant user load and time were required for the issue to manifest, meaning that the issue was not observed in internal testing, or in most of BigQuery's production regions.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nBigQuery will take the following actions to mitigate against such issues happening in the future: - In the short-term, enable comprehensive memory error detector coverage for the affected code path to detect possible memory leaks ahead of time. - In the long-term, ensure such analysis is enabled for all BigQuery code paths.\nIntroduce additional internal monitoring to detect memory pressure scenarios.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nIn affected regions, a portion of BigQuery compute nodes were unable to service incoming jobs due to insufficient memory. As a result customer jobs - including queries, loads, and exports - experienced elevated latencies and failures while waiting for nodes with sufficient memory to become available.",

      "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 24 May 2022 from 18:04 to 25 May 2022 10:34 Google BigQuery experienced elevated query latencies and job failures in four regions (US multiregion, europe-west1, asia-east1, and asia-east2) for a duration of 16 hours, 30 minutes. A product change roll out was identified as the root cause. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the changes. The rollback was performed in phases to prevent additional impact on the service, which caused some regions to recover earlier than others. Affected customers experienced elevated latencies or failures for QUERY, IMPORT and EXPORT jobs in BigQuery.\n**Root Cause:**\nOn 11 May 2022, BigQuery began a software rollout to improve audit logging for data that is imported from, queried, or exported to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This rollout inadvertently contained a memory leak that gradually and incrementally manifested whenever these code paths were executed. This memory leak gradually consumed memory on BigQuery’s compute nodes until they were unable to accept new work to execute jobs, including queries, loads, and exports. The software rollout was deployed to all regions before the issue was detected and rolled back. Given the nature of the root cause, significant user load and time were required for the issue to manifest, meaning that the issue was not observed in internal testing, or in most of BigQuery's production regions.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nBigQuery will take the following actions to mitigate against such issues happening in the future: - In the short-term, enable comprehensive memory error detector coverage for the affected code path to detect possible memory leaks ahead of time. - In the long-term, ensure such analysis is enabled for all BigQuery code paths.\nIntroduce additional internal monitoring to detect memory pressure scenarios.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nIn affected regions, a portion of BigQuery compute nodes were unable to service incoming jobs due to insufficient memory. As a result customer jobs - including queries, loads, and exports - experienced elevated latencies and failures while waiting for nodes with sufficient memory to become available.",

        "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**SUMMARY:**\nOn Friday, 20 May 2022 at 13:47 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Networking experienced intermittent packet loss for traffic between multiple cloud regions for a duration of 20 minutes. The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 14:07 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA failure of a component on a fiber path from one of the central US gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss while the backbone automatically moved traffic onto remaining paths.\nThe network topology in this region is being augmented, and the second-best path has not completed its augmentation. This meant some traffic needed to reroute onto the third-best path, which led to an extended traffic migration period. This disruption was more severe than we had anticipated, and is the subject of remediation actions below.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 13:47 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 14:06 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this event affected our customers.\nWe have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve are ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nIn this network region, we intend to complete the augmentation by 11 July 2022, which will return the network to the intended topology where any single fiber path failure can be rerouted quickly onto the second-best path.\nWe will also build automatic analysis to ensure that the network topology during augmentation always supports fast convergence.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT:**\n- Google Cloud Networking - Affected customers would have observed packet loss for ingress and egress traffic to and from US Central Cloud regions from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud VPN - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors for cross region VPN with global routing from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific. Intra-region traffic for Classic and HA VPN would not have been affected.\n- Cloud Router - Affected customers would have observed delays in global routing propagation from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud Interconnect - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Google Cloud Storage - Affected customers would have experienced elevated latency, HTTP 500 errors, or transient API errors from 13:47 to 14:17 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud SQL - Affected customers would have experienced failures for Export, Update, and Delete operations as well as delayed data replication in us-west1 from 13:53 to 14:13 US/Pacific.\n- Messages - Affected customers would have experienced service availability issues from 13:49 to 14:05 US/Pacific.",

      "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**SUMMARY:**\nOn Friday, 20 May 2022 at 13:47 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Networking experienced intermittent packet loss for traffic between multiple cloud regions for a duration of 20 minutes. The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 14:07 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA failure of a component on a fiber path from one of the central US gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss while the backbone automatically moved traffic onto remaining paths.\nThe network topology in this region is being augmented, and the second-best path has not completed its augmentation. This meant some traffic needed to reroute onto the third-best path, which led to an extended traffic migration period. This disruption was more severe than we had anticipated, and is the subject of remediation actions below.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 13:47 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 14:06 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this event affected our customers.\nWe have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve are ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nIn this network region, we intend to complete the augmentation by 11 July 2022, which will return the network to the intended topology where any single fiber path failure can be rerouted quickly onto the second-best path.\nWe will also build automatic analysis to ensure that the network topology during augmentation always supports fast convergence.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT:**\n- Google Cloud Networking - Affected customers would have observed packet loss for ingress and egress traffic to and from US Central Cloud regions from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud VPN - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors for cross region VPN with global routing from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific. Intra-region traffic for Classic and HA VPN would not have been affected.\n- Cloud Router - Affected customers would have observed delays in global routing propagation from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud Interconnect - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Google Cloud Storage - Affected customers would have experienced elevated latency, HTTP 500 errors, or transient API errors from 13:47 to 14:17 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud SQL - Affected customers would have experienced failures for Export, Update, and Delete operations as well as delayed data replication in us-west1 from 13:53 to 14:13 US/Pacific.\n- Messages - Affected customers would have experienced service availability issues from 13:49 to 14:05 US/Pacific.",

These issues mostly were isolated to us-central1-b for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic could be shifted away from the impacted zone. Most Google Cloud services recovered automatically, after the underlying problem was resolved.\nWe sincerely apologize for the impact to your service or application. We completed an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve the quality and reliability of our services. If you believe that your services experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please [contact us](https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla).\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle Cloud systems are built on a zonal distributed storage system called [Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system), which replicates data across a large number of individual storage servers called D Servers. In this incident, a background job responsible for repacking storage objects began to retry those repack operations more aggressively as part of its normal operations. This subsequently increased the load on the Colossus system in the zone, including the number of open connections to the D Servers.\nThe sudden increase in connection load to D Servers caused a small number of servers to unexpectedly crash due to high memory pressure. This led our automated management systems to remove them from the serving fleet for Colossus. This further reduced the number of D Servers available to handle the rising traffic loads and increased the traffic latency within the Colossus system in the impacted zone.\nThis significant increase in latency subsequently impacted our customers’ performance across a range of Google Cloud services that are built atop Colossus, including Persistent Disk, BigQuery, and many others.\nThis zonal incident impacted some regional services due to the specific failure mode. When a Colossus cluster is marked down, the regional services receive proactive notification and automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Since this cluster was still up, but with variable latency for some operations, the regional services received no proactive notification and were unable to automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Therefore, the impact to a number of regional services was extended as they had to manually remove the impacted cluster from serving.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on Friday, 6 May, 2022 at 01:54 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineers stopped the background traffic. To increase traffic capacity, Google engineers re-added the impacted D Servers to the serving fleet, mitigating the issue at 12:06 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We are taking the following steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n* Investigate and add additional protections in the D Servers to decrease memory pressure during high network traffic load periods.\n* Improve the retry logic for the storage object repacking job to ensure that it cannot overload the Colossus system within a zone.\n* Extend the automated D Server management systems to better handle crash loop conditions and quickly restore D Servers to production once they become healthy.\n* Google's regional services are designed to tolerate zonal failure while staying within their service level objectives. The nature of this failure was not properly handled by some regional services. We are committed to investigating the behavior of each regional service impacted in this outage to ensure that fault tolerance gaps are properly addressed.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nSome customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted region.\n* **BigQuery [us-central1 and US multi-region]:** Customers saw increased query, import, and export latencies and errors. The overall duration of impact was 6 hours 5 minutes in us-central1 and 4 hours 34 minutes in US multi-region.\n* **Cloud Bigtable [us-central1-b zone]:** A small number of Customers in us-central1-b experienced elevated latency and errors as well as replication delays for a duration of 10 hours, 36 minutes. A very minor percentage of the affected customers for Cloud Bigtable had residual impact for additional 6 hours, 40 minutes.\n* **Cloud Pub/Sub [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen missing backlog stats metrics for subscriptions against topics with messages published to us-central1 for a duration of 2 hours, 41 minutes. Since the impact was based on the message publish region, the subscribers could have been in regions other than us-central1.\n* **Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) [us-central1-b zone]:** New load balancer creations and modifications or deletions of existing components with backends in us-central1-b may have been delayed or not taken effect until the outage was resolved. The total impact duration for GCLB is 4 hours, 46 minutes.\n* **Google Compute Engine (GCE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have seen issues with instance availability in us-central1-b due to some input/output (I/O) operations in Persistent Disk Standard disks being stuck for over one minute. Additionally, Regional Persistent Disk Standard disks with a replica in us-central1-b may have been briefly affected due to delays in failover. A small number of instances may have experienced brief loss of network connectivity to other Google Cloud services following live migration events. The total impact duration for GCE is around 5 hours, 25 minutes.\n* **Cloud Datastream [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen streams enter into \"Failed\" state on the Datastream UI, noticed no new data ingested by Datastream into Google Cloud Storage buckets, had duplicate data loaded into Google Cloud Storage, or metrics not being reported. This impacted a whole region for a duration of 7 hours 40 minutes, because the cluster over provisioning was not at a high enough level, and losing one zone on the underlying Kafka cluster caused the cluster to be at 100% utilization, until it was able to fully copy the data to a new zone.\n* **Cloud Filestore [us-central1-b zone]:** Many Filestore instance creation operations failed. Additionally, a small number of instances were unresponsive for the duration of the incident. Some instances suffered performance impact.\n* **Cloud Memorystore [us-central1-b zone]:** Redis nodes in us-central1-b may have been unavailable for a duration of 3 hours, 54 minutes.\n* **Cloud SQL [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may not have been able to connect to their instance in us-central1-b through the Cloud SQL Auth proxy for a duration of 3 hours, 5 minutes.\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have experienced issues interacting with their clusters' control planes. New workloads may not have been scheduled. Auto scaling may not have been operational.The total impact duration for GKE is 7 hours, 11 minutes.\n* **Apigee [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen errors for their API traffic with Datastore Errors. Apigee is internally redundant across zones within the region, but due to the high latency failure mode in us-central1-b, the engineers were not able to remove the impacted zone from the regional cluster. The total impact duration for Apigee is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Dataflow [us-central1 region]:** New Dataflow jobs may have failed to start in us-central1-b. Jobs already running in us-central1-b may have been stuck or delayed, but restarting the jobs would have automatically routed them to a healthy zone starting at 05:00 US/Pacific if the customer was using auto zone placement. The total impact duration for dataflow is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Cloud Data Fusion (CDF) [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have experienced DataFusion instance creation failures, instance availability issues and higher data processing pipeline failures. This was because Persistent Disk (PD) issues caused DataFusion backend services to become unhealthy and the total impact duration was about 7 hours.",

These issues were predominantly isolated to us-central1-b for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic could be shifted away from the impacted zone. Most services recovered automatically after the underlying problem was resolved.\nThe issues were triggered by an unexpected increase in normally occurring background traffic in the Google Cloud distributed storage infrastructure[1] within the us-central1-b zone. The system automatically directed load away from backend file servers that were impacted by this load increase. This subsequently reduced the overall traffic capacity in the zone. Google engineers mitigated the issue by stopping the background traffic and marking the impacted file servers as available in order to increase capacity.\n**Customer Impact:**\n**How Customers Experienced the Issue:** Some customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted region.\n* **BigQuery:** Customers may have seen increased query delays and/or failures.\n* **Cloud Bigtable:** Customers may have experienced elevated latency and errors.\n* **Cloud Pub/Sub:** Customers may have seen missing metrics for backlog statistics.\n* **Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB):** New load balancer creations, as well as modifications or deletions of existing components, with backends in us-central1-b may have been delayed or not taken effect until the outage was resolved.\n* **Google Compute Engine (GCE):** Customers may have seen issues with instance availability in us-central1-b due to some input/output (I/O) operations in Persistent Disk being stuck for over one minute. A small number of instances may have experienced brief loss of network reachability to other Google Cloud services following live migration events.\n* **Datastream:** Customers may have seen streams enter into \"Failed\" state on the Datastream UI, noticed no new data ingested by Datastream into Google Cloud Storage bucket, or metrics not being reported.\n* **Cloud Filestore:** Customers may have experienced hung tasks in Filestore instances.\n* **Cloud Memorystore:** Redis nodes in us-central1-b may have been unavailable.\n* **Cloud SQL:** Customers may not have been able to connect to their instance in us-central1-b through the proxy-server.\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** Customers may have experienced issues interacting with the control plane.

      "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 6 May 2022 at 01:30 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced issues in the us-central1 region. These issues mostly were isolated to us-central1-b for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic could be shifted away from the impacted zone. Most Google Cloud services recovered automatically, after the underlying problem was resolved.\nWe sincerely apologize for the impact to your service or application. We completed an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve the quality and reliability of our services. If you believe that your services experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please [contact us](https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla).\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle Cloud systems are built on a zonal distributed storage system called [Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system), which replicates data across a large number of individual storage servers called D Servers. In this incident, a background job responsible for repacking storage objects began to retry those repack operations more aggressively as part of its normal operations. This subsequently increased the load on the Colossus system in the zone, including the number of open connections to the D Servers.\nThe sudden increase in connection load to D Servers caused a small number of servers to unexpectedly crash due to high memory pressure. This led our automated management systems to remove them from the serving fleet for Colossus. This further reduced the number of D Servers available to handle the rising traffic loads and increased the traffic latency within the Colossus system in the impacted zone.\nThis significant increase in latency subsequently impacted our customers’ performance across a range of Google Cloud services that are built atop Colossus, including Persistent Disk, BigQuery, and many others.\nThis zonal incident impacted some regional services due to the specific failure mode. When a Colossus cluster is marked down, the regional services receive proactive notification and automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Since this cluster was still up, but with variable latency for some operations, the regional services received no proactive notification and were unable to automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Therefore, the impact to a number of regional services was extended as they had to manually remove the impacted cluster from serving.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on Friday, 6 May, 2022 at 01:54 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineers stopped the background traffic. To increase traffic capacity, Google engineers re-added the impacted D Servers to the serving fleet, mitigating the issue at 12:06 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We are taking the following steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n* Investigate and add additional protections in the D Servers to decrease memory pressure during high network traffic load periods.\n* Improve the retry logic for the storage object repacking job to ensure that it cannot overload the Colossus system within a zone.\n* Extend the automated D Server management systems to better handle crash loop conditions and quickly restore D Servers to production once they become healthy.\n* Google's regional services are designed to tolerate zonal failure while staying within their service level objectives. The nature of this failure was not properly handled by some regional services. We are committed to investigating the behavior of each regional service impacted in this outage to ensure that fault tolerance gaps are properly addressed.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nSome customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted region.\n* **BigQuery [us-central1 and US multi-region]:** Customers saw increased query, import, and export latencies and errors. The overall duration of impact was 6 hours 5 minutes in us-central1 and 4 hours 34 minutes in US multi-region.\n* **Cloud Bigtable [us-central1-b zone]:** A small number of Customers in us-central1-b experienced elevated latency and errors as well as replication delays for a duration of 10 hours, 36 minutes. A very minor percentage of the affected customers for Cloud Bigtable had residual impact for additional 6 hours, 40 minutes.\n* **Cloud Pub/Sub [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen missing backlog stats metrics for subscriptions against topics with messages published to us-central1 for a duration of 2 hours, 41 minutes. Since the impact was based on the message publish region, the subscribers could have been in regions other than us-central1.\n* **Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) [us-central1-b zone]:** New load balancer creations and modifications or deletions of existing components with backends in us-central1-b may have been delayed or not taken effect until the outage was resolved. The total impact duration for GCLB is 4 hours, 46 minutes.\n* **Google Compute Engine (GCE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have seen issues with instance availability in us-central1-b due to some input/output (I/O) operations in Persistent Disk Standard disks being stuck for over one minute. Additionally, Regional Persistent Disk Standard disks with a replica in us-central1-b may have been briefly affected due to delays in failover. A small number of instances may have experienced brief loss of network connectivity to other Google Cloud services following live migration events. The total impact duration for GCE is around 5 hours, 25 minutes.\n* **Cloud Datastream [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen streams enter into \"Failed\" state on the Datastream UI, noticed no new data ingested by Datastream into Google Cloud Storage buckets, had duplicate data loaded into Google Cloud Storage, or metrics not being reported. This impacted a whole region for a duration of 7 hours 40 minutes, because the cluster over provisioning was not at a high enough level, and losing one zone on the underlying Kafka cluster caused the cluster to be at 100% utilization, until it was able to fully copy the data to a new zone.\n* **Cloud Filestore [us-central1-b zone]:** Many Filestore instance creation operations failed. Additionally, a small number of instances were unresponsive for the duration of the incident. Some instances suffered performance impact.\n* **Cloud Memorystore [us-central1-b zone]:** Redis nodes in us-central1-b may have been unavailable for a duration of 3 hours, 54 minutes.\n* **Cloud SQL [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may not have been able to connect to their instance in us-central1-b through the Cloud SQL Auth proxy for a duration of 3 hours, 5 minutes.\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have experienced issues interacting with their clusters' control planes. New workloads may not have been scheduled. Auto scaling may not have been operational.The total impact duration for GKE is 7 hours, 11 minutes.\n* **Apigee [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen errors for their API traffic with Datastore Errors. Apigee is internally redundant across zones within the region, but due to the high latency failure mode in us-central1-b, the engineers were not able to remove the impacted zone from the regional cluster. The total impact duration for Apigee is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Dataflow [us-central1 region]:** New Dataflow jobs may have failed to start in us-central1-b. Jobs already running in us-central1-b may have been stuck or delayed, but restarting the jobs would have automatically routed them to a healthy zone starting at 05:00 US/Pacific if the customer was using auto zone placement. The total impact duration for dataflow is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Cloud Data Fusion (CDF) [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have experienced DataFusion instance creation failures, instance availability issues and higher data processing pipeline failures. This was because Persistent Disk (PD) issues caused DataFusion backend services to become unhealthy and the total impact duration was about 7 hours.",

Additionally, customers were unable to create, view, or search support cases in the Google Cloud Support Center and Google Admin Console for 1 hour and 24 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the impact to your service or application. We have completed an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve our service’s quality and reliability.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe Serverless stack relies on a file serving service for container images. The issue was triggered when the file serving component of the Serverless stack experienced a sudden increase in traffic. A bug, introduced in a recent configuration change to the file serving service, was surfaced by the sudden increase in traffic, causing many threads to get stuck. This led to resource exhaustion on the affected file servers, causing some tasks to crash and preventing new requests from completing.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on Thursday, 28 April 2022, at 07:11 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the affected component was identified, engineers added additional capacity to the component in the zone that was experiencing the degradation. This mitigated the resource exhaustion, and the service recovered at 08:20 US/Pacific.\nTo prevent recurrence of the issue, engineers rolled back the configuration change to the previous stable version and implemented an automated release block to prevent any unintended release of a version that included the bug.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We are taking the following steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\nTo improve resolution time for future issues of this type, we are calibrating our alerting system to give us an earlier and more precise notification which will allow us to diagnose the issue more quickly.\nWe are also evaluating what kinds of load/stress tests could deterministically detect this kind of issue in the future, so that such regressions are caught automatically before they are deployed to production.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn 28th April 2022 from 7:00 PT to 8:32 PT\n**Google App Engine**\nGoogle App Engine experienced increased latency and reduced availability in one zone in us-central1 for a period of 1 hour and 32 minutes. Customers may have experienced increased latency or higher error rate for App Engine projects.\n**Google Cloud Functions**\nGoogle Cloud Functions experienced increased latency and reduced availability in one zone in us-central1 for a period of 1 hour and 32 minutes. “Google Cloud Functions” customers updating their functions (e.g. deploying a new version) may have experienced increased latency or failures, notably failing health checks.\n**Google Cloud Support and Google Workspace Support**\nCustomers were unable to create, view, or search support cases in the Google Cloud Support Center or Google Admin Console for 1 hour and 24 minutes. In addition, a small number of customers had degraded access to phone support, being redirected to a queue requiring additional manual authentication with the support agent.",

Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for a duration of 20 hours, 41 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, an unexpected increase in uncached NOT_FOUND errors while validating log bucket configurations caused a large increase in the overall volume of configuration reads. This in turn caused latency of configuration reads and therefore validations to increase, leading to an ingestion backlog and a delay in log ingestion to the storage layer of our query backend.\nThe issue was resolved at 17:33 US/Pacific once the ingestion backlog cleared.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for most of the duration of the event.\n- Customers may have experienced high latency or failures up to 90% on reads from Google Cloud Logging and other query requests.",

Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for a duration of 20 hours, 41 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, an unexpected increase in uncached NOT_FOUND errors while validating log bucket configurations caused a large increase in the overall volume of configuration reads. This in turn caused latency of configuration reads and therefore validations to increase, leading to an ingestion backlog and a delay in log ingestion to the storage layer of our query backend.\nThe issue was resolved at 17:33 US/Pacific once the ingestion backlog cleared.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for most of the duration of the event.\n- Customers may have experienced high latency or failures up to 90% on reads from Google Cloud Logging and other query requests.",

Google apologizes to customers who were affected by this outage and is taking steps to ensure that this type of outage does not reoccur.\n**Root Cause**\nOur investigation found the cause was a backend configuration change to our Cloud Monitoring service. This configuration changed the computation of some metrics not directly related to, but shared by, Cloud Pub/Sub. This configuration change progressively rolled out across all Google Cloud regions over two hours.\nThis configuration change increased the latency of requests to record metrics sent from Cloud Pub/Sub to Cloud Monitoring and, in some cases, resulted in failures due to write operations timing out.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nEngineers were able to mitigate the issue by reverting the change that caused the issue, restoring services for all customers at 15:54 US/Pacific.\nWe are taking the following actions to ensure this does not happen again:\n- Improving the monitoring of Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting to allow for quicker error detection.\n- Making Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting operations more resilient to high latency.\n- Improving internal visibility and vetting of Cloud Monitoring backend configuration changes.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Thursday March 31st, between 08:30 and 15:54 US/Pacific time:\n**Cloud Pub/Sub Metrics in Cloud Reporting**\n- The metric values lost during this timeframe are not recoverable.\n- Any alerting based on these metrics might have fired erroneously or not fired when it should have.\n- Auto scaling of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) based on these metrics may not have functioned as expected.",

Google apologizes to customers who were affected by this outage and is taking steps to ensure that this type of outage does not reoccur.\n**Root Cause**\nOur investigation found the cause was a backend configuration change to our Cloud Monitoring service. This configuration changed the computation of some metrics not directly related to, but shared by, Cloud Pub/Sub. This configuration change progressively rolled out across all Google Cloud regions over two hours.\nThis configuration change increased the latency of requests to record metrics sent from Cloud Pub/Sub to Cloud Monitoring and, in some cases, resulted in failures due to write operations timing out.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nEngineers were able to mitigate the issue by reverting the change that caused the issue, restoring services for all customers at 15:54 US/Pacific.\nWe are taking the following actions to ensure this does not happen again:\n- Improving the monitoring of Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting to allow for quicker error detection.\n- Making Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting operations more resilient to high latency.\n- Improving internal visibility and vetting of Cloud Monitoring backend configuration changes.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Thursday March 31st, between 08:30 and 15:54 US/Pacific time:\n**Cloud Pub/Sub Metrics in Cloud Reporting**\n- The metric values lost during this timeframe are not recoverable.\n- Any alerting based on these metrics might have fired erroneously or not fired when it should have.\n- Auto scaling of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) based on these metrics may not have functioned as expected.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 25 March 2022 00:00\n**Incident End:** 25 March 2022 00:16\n**Duration:** 16 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking\n**Regions/Zones:** Multiple regions\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced packet loss due to transient failures on several fiber paths between two metro locations in the US northwest region and US central region. This packet loss led to disruption of traffic between multiple cloud regions globally. Most of the transient failures were cleared by 25 March 2022, 00:08 US/Pacific mitigating the issue for global regions.\nAn unrelated transient fiber failure in the Asia region caused an additional minor disruption that was limited only to the APAC region between 25 March 2022 00:10 US/Pacific and 25 March 2022 00:16 US/Pacific.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers may have experienced issues with transit traffic between multiple Google Cloud regions. Following are the cloud regions which were affected the most:\n* Traffic FROM us-east2 TO asia-east1\n* Traffic FROM all europe regions TO us-west1, asia-east1and asia-south2\n* Traffic FROM us-east1, us-east2, us-east4 TO us-west1, asia-east1and asia-south2\n* Traffic FROM us-central1 TO us-west1, asia-east1and asia-south2",

Affected customers may have experienced high latency, high retransmits and elevated errors.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s wide-area network is primarily comprised of infrastructure owned and operated by Google, although some physical links use fiber infrastructure which is owned and operated by third parties. Google has multiple resilient fiber paths and network points of presence serving users in Mexico.\nMultiple simultaneous fiber cuts on diversely-routed paths, at the same time as a planned maintenance event on another diversely-routed path, resulted in a capacity shortfall in Google’s wide-area network between Queretaro, Mexico and the United States. This multiple failure event represents a rare case in which the resulting capacity shortfall was visible to Google's users.\nTraffic was subsequently redirected to alternate links; however, there was insufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss for user-facing network traffic to Google from users in Mexico.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanism detected the congestion on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 15:42 US/Pacific and redirected the traffic through alternate edge locations. However, the alternate link did not have sufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss. The congestion was cleared when traffic was manually routed around the failed links on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 17:15 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. However, this incident was the result of multiple concurrent failures on links which are designed to provide resilience; such failures, whilst very rare, are expected at a low frequency. We are taking the following steps to ensure we respond quickly to similar events in the future:\n* Improving the reliability of tooling that manually reroutes traffic in extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\n* Improving the diagnostic systems that help Google's Cloud Networking teams decide how to deal with extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\nWe appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 22 March 2022 from 15:30 to 17:15 US/Pacific, customers reaching Google services from Mexico may have experienced network slowness and packet loss, and errors returned from our services.

The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 15:28 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA rare hardware failure of a component on the fiber paths from one of the transpacific gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:20 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:28 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this rare event affected our customers. We have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve still further remain ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions.

The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 15:28 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA rare hardware failure of a component on the fiber paths from one of the transpacific gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:20 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:28 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this rare event affected our customers. We have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve still further remain ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nCustomers may have observed packet loss for traffic routed via transpacific links on Google's backbone.

        "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary**\nOn Tuesday, 8 March 2022, Traffic Director users, who had service mesh with Traffic Director-managed backends, experienced elevated service errors for 2 hours and 35 minutes. To our Traffic Director customers who were impacted during this service disruption, we sincerely apologize. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Root Cause**\nTraffic Director has a configuration pipeline that distributes customer configurations to Traffic Director infrastructure globally. The configuration pipeline has been undergoing a multi-stage, multi-year architectural rewrite to address a number of limitations in the previous architecture. One step to move to the new architecture has been to migrate existing Traffic Director configurations to a different format. This data migration has been ongoing since November 2021. The Traffic Director code was updated to handle both old and new formats of the configuration.\nThe data format migration was not fully completed; it encountered sporadic failures that were believed to only affect test configurations of new unreleased features. These failures masked the true completion state for full migration of all customer data. As a result, some customer data was an inconsistent state of old and new formats.\nOn 8 March 2022 at 10:05 PT, a change to the Traffic Director code that processes the configuration was updated. The code change assumed that the configuration data format migration was fully completed. In fact, the data migration had not completed. The failures were believed to only affect test configurations of new unreleased features, but they also affected a certain set of customer configurations that met all of the following criteria:\n1. The project was part of a Shared VPC.\n2. The project had at least one configuration migrated to the new format, which would be true if: a. The customer modified the project configuration after 12 November 2021; or b. The internal migration tool successfully processed the configuration.\n3. The project had at least one configuration that was not migrated to the new format: a. The customer had not modified the project since 12 November 2021; or b.The internal migration tool failed to process the configuration.\n4. The hostname of interest was part of the migrated configuration or the data plane requested configuration from the Traffic Director based on the migrated configuration.\nIt would inadvertently delete the configurations which caused the downstream clients to lose their programming and deconfigure the data plane.\nThe change was rolled back, the configurations were recovered, and service was restored for all users.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue through a customer support case on 8 March 2022 at 10:24 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers rolled back the Traffic Director configuration rollout to prevent additional customer impact.\nAt 12:42 US/Pacific, engineers forced a reprogramming of configurations, which mitigated the issue.\nWe sincerely apologize for the length and severity of this incident. Our team at Google is taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 8 March 2022 from 10:07 to 12:42 US/Pacific, customers using Traffic Director-managed backends experienced elevated service errors. Affected customers would have seen their Traffic Director managed clients deprogrammed as the configuration was removed. The effect of the deprogramming for users behind Google Cloud Load Balancers (GCLB) would have been visible as 500 errors. Some affected customers were able to mitigate the issue for themselves through the workaround of moving to backends that were not Traffic Director managed.",

      "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary**\nOn Tuesday, 8 March 2022, Traffic Director users, who had service mesh with Traffic Director-managed backends, experienced elevated service errors for 2 hours and 35 minutes. To our Traffic Director customers who were impacted during this service disruption, we sincerely apologize. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Root Cause**\nTraffic Director has a configuration pipeline that distributes customer configurations to Traffic Director infrastructure globally. The configuration pipeline has been undergoing a multi-stage, multi-year architectural rewrite to address a number of limitations in the previous architecture. One step to move to the new architecture has been to migrate existing Traffic Director configurations to a different format. This data migration has been ongoing since November 2021. The Traffic Director code was updated to handle both old and new formats of the configuration.\nThe data format migration was not fully completed; it encountered sporadic failures that were believed to only affect test configurations of new unreleased features. These failures masked the true completion state for full migration of all customer data. As a result, some customer data was an inconsistent state of old and new formats.\nOn 8 March 2022 at 10:05 PT, a change to the Traffic Director code that processes the configuration was updated. The code change assumed that the configuration data format migration was fully completed. In fact, the data migration had not completed. The failures were believed to only affect test configurations of new unreleased features, but they also affected a certain set of customer configurations that met all of the following criteria:\n1. The project was part of a Shared VPC.\n2. The project had at least one configuration migrated to the new format, which would be true if: a. The customer modified the project configuration after 12 November 2021; or b. The internal migration tool successfully processed the configuration.\n3. The project had at least one configuration that was not migrated to the new format: a. The customer had not modified the project since 12 November 2021; or b.The internal migration tool failed to process the configuration.\n4. The hostname of interest was part of the migrated configuration or the data plane requested configuration from the Traffic Director based on the migrated configuration.\nIt would inadvertently delete the configurations which caused the downstream clients to lose their programming and deconfigure the data plane.\nThe change was rolled back, the configurations were recovered, and service was restored for all users.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue through a customer support case on 8 March 2022 at 10:24 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers rolled back the Traffic Director configuration rollout to prevent additional customer impact.\nAt 12:42 US/Pacific, engineers forced a reprogramming of configurations, which mitigated the issue.\nWe sincerely apologize for the length and severity of this incident. Our team at Google is taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 8 March 2022 from 10:07 to 12:42 US/Pacific, customers using Traffic Director-managed backends experienced elevated service errors. Affected customers would have seen their Traffic Director managed clients deprogrammed as the configuration was removed. The effect of the deprogramming for users behind Google Cloud Load Balancers (GCLB) would have been visible as 500 errors. Some affected customers were able to mitigate the issue for themselves through the workaround of moving to backends that were not Traffic Director managed.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a change triggered by a recent rollout.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected .Net services observed \"upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: remote reset\" when a request was made using HTTP/2 or gRPC.\n**Additional Details:**\nThe ability to disable \"preserve_downstream_scheme\" was removed upstream in Envoy proxy [1] which led to an unintentional breaking change in Cloud Run. The breaking change introduces an incompatibility with .NET default enforcement between incoming transport-layer security and “:scheme” header (see details [2] ). The Cloud Run and Envoy teams at Google were able to mitigate the issue once identified, and have taken steps to limit and better manage such changes in the future.\nThe issue was fully resolved on 24 February 2022 at 20:48 US/Pacific once a rollback of the change was completed.\n* [1] - https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/current#removed-config-or-runtime\n* [2] - https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30532",

        "text": "# UPDATED INCIDENT REPORT\n## Summary\nOn Saturday, 8 January 2022, multiple GCP products in us-west1-b experienced increased network latency for a duration of 3 hours and 22 minutes. To our affected customers in us-west1-b who were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle leverages \"Software-defined Networking” (SDN) to simplify and automate the growth and expansion of our data center networks. This allows us to dynamically scale up data center networks to meet customer demand. This outage began when a routine maintenance event was performed on one of the SDN components. This maintenance event triggered an application failover that prompted a newly active replica to perform reconciliation from a previous checkpoint. These events are expected to be seamless and cause no network disruption. However, the checkpoint data was incorrectly missing a particular piece of configuration information; this was propagated to ~15% of the network switches serving us-west1-b.\nSeconds after this event, the SDN automatically corrected the incomplete configuration. Reprogramming of the affected switches triggered a race condition within the switch firmware, eventually causing them to crash. Automatic repair and mitigation actions were invoked within 10 minutes of switches failing. However, the unexpectedly large number, and network proximity, of the failures prevented a fully automatic recovery. As such, the outage was not mitigated until on-call engineers manually recovered the affected switches. The corrupted checkpoint data was only present in a single location and therefore no other cloud zone was ever at risk.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nThe outage was detected by Google Engineers on Saturday, 8 January at 15:25 US/Pacific, who immediately started an investigation. At 16:03, engineers tried to migrate traffic away from the impacted switches in the switch fabric, but this did not resolve the issue. At 17:19, engineers ascertained that the impacted switches needed to have their services restarted, and at 17:37, they began to do so. The network issue was mitigated at 18:00, when enough switches had been restarted to successfully serve all network traffic. The issue was fully resolved by 18:36, when all services were marked as recovered.\nThe conditions that caused this disruption existed only in a small subset of Google's network. The function responsible for causing it has been disabled and will not be reenabled until the steps below have been fully implemented.\n1. Avoiding the trigger: - We have audited and disabled the SDN feature that triggered this incident. - We have identified test coverage gaps in our SDN release process, which will be addressed to prevent a repeat of this and other similar issues. - Our systems will be modified to validate SDN checkpoint data before it is persisted for later recovery. - Our SDN maintenance workflow safety checks will be enhanced to automatically stop the workflow during an outage.\n2. Ensure changes are applied to the SDN more progressively: - We will redistribute SDN services to limit the areas impacted by failed maintenance workflows. - We will be developing new SDN safety components that validate potentially disruptive operations by applying them to network devices that are similarly configured, but not currently active, before deploying them further.\n3. Reduce time to resolution: - We will improve network management tooling to simplify and expedite mass switch recovery. - We will deploy monitoring improvements to more quickly identify broad network switch failures.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Saturday, 8 January from 15:15 to 18:36 US/Pacific:\n#### Cloud Router\nAffected Cloud Router customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud VPN\nAffected Cloud VPN customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud DNS\nCloud DNS customers experienced increased latency and errors on DNS requests.\n#### Cloud AI\nCloud AI customers experienced elevated latency on prediction requests.\n#### Cloud Run\nCloud Run customers experienced network connectivity issues.\n#### Cloud Spanner\nCloud Spanner Customers experienced elevated latency.\n#### Google Compute Engine\nGoogle Compute Engine customers experienced network latency, connectivity issues and slow input/output (I/O) operations on disks due to network latency, which may have manifested as unresponsive Compute Engine instances, including Google Kubernetes instances.\n#### Other Services\nOther services that require Google Cloud Networking in us-west1-b were also affected.

The corrupted checkpoint data was only present in a single location and therefore no other cloud zone was ever at risk.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nThe outage was detected by Google Engineers on Saturday, 8 January at 15:25 US/Pacific, who immediately started an investigation. At 16:03, engineers tried to migrate traffic away from the impacted switches in the switch fabric, but this did not resolve the issue. At 17:19, engineers ascertained that the impacted switches needed to have their services restarted, and at 17:37, they began to do so. The network issue was mitigated at 18:00, when enough switches had been restarted to successfully serve all network traffic. The issue was fully resolved by 18:36, when all services were marked as recovered.\nThe conditions that caused this disruption existed only in a small subset of Google's network. The function responsible for causing it has been disabled and will not be reenabled until the steps below have been fully implemented.\n1. Avoiding the trigger: - We have audited and disabled the SDN feature that triggered this incident. - We have identified test coverage gaps in our SDN release process, which will be addressed to prevent a repeat of this and other similar issues. - Our systems will be modified to validate SDN checkpoint data before it is persisted for later recovery. - Our SDN maintenance workflow safety checks will be enhanced to automatically stop the workflow during an outage.\n2. Ensure changes are applied to the SDN more progressively: - We will redistribute SDN services to limit the areas impacted by failed maintenance workflows. - We will be developing new SDN safety components that validate potentially disruptive operations by applying them to network devices that are similarly configured, but not currently active, before deploying them further.\n3. Reduce time to resolution: - We will improve network management tooling to simplify and expedite mass switch recovery. - We will deploy monitoring improvements to more quickly identify broad network switch failures.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Saturday, 8 January from 15:15 to 18:36 US/Pacific:\n#### Cloud Router\nAffected Cloud Router customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud VPN\nAffected Cloud VPN customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud DNS\nCloud DNS customers experienced increased latency and errors on DNS requests.\n#### Cloud AI\nCloud AI customers experienced elevated latency on prediction requests.\n#### Cloud Run\nCloud Run customers experienced network connectivity issues.\n#### Cloud Spanner\nCloud Spanner Customers experienced elevated latency.\n#### Google Compute Engine\nGoogle Compute Engine customers experienced network latency, connectivity issues and slow input/output (I/O) operations on disks due to network latency, which may have manifested as unresponsive Compute Engine instances, including Google Kubernetes instances.\n#### Other Services\nOther services that require Google Cloud Networking in us-west1-b were also affected. Customers would experience latency, errors, and delays.",

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve the issue.\nWe want to share some information about what happened and the steps we are taking to ensure this issue doesn’t occur again. We also want to assure you that this service disruption does not have any bearing on our preparedness or platform reliability going into Black Friday/Cyber Monday (BFCM).\n## Incident Summary\nOn Tuesday, 16 November 2021 at 09:35 PT, Google Cloud Networking experienced issues with the Google External Proxy Load Balancing (GCLB) service. Affected customers received Google 404 errors in response to HTTP/S requests.\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via automated alerting at 09:50 PT, which aligned with incoming customer support requests, and we immediately started to mitigate the issue by rolling back to the last known good configuration.\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, customers affected by the outage may have encountered 404 errors when accessing any web page (URL) served by Google External Proxy Load Balancing.\nA rollback to the last known good configuration completed at 10:08 PT, which resolved the 404 errors. To avoid the risk of a recurrence, our engineers suspended customer-initiated configuration changes in GCLB. As a result, GCLB service customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration between 10:04 and 11:28 PT.\nDuring the change suspension period, we validated the fix to safeguard against recurrence and deployed additional proctoring and monitoring to ensure safe resumption of service.\nBy 11:28 PT, customer configuration pushes resumed, and normal service was restored. The total duration of impact was 1 hour and 53 minutes.\n## Root Cause\nThis incident was caused by a bug in the configuration pipeline that propagates customer configuration rules to GCLB. The bug was introduced 6 months ago and allowed a race condition (when behavior depends on the timing of data accesses) that would, in very rare cases, push a corrupted configuration file to GCLB. The GCLB update pipeline contains extensive validation checks to prevent corrupt configurations, but the race condition was one that could corrupt the file near the end of the pipeline.\nA Google engineer discovered this bug on 12 November, which caused us to declare an internal high-priority incident because of the latent risk to production systems. After analyzing the bug, we froze a part of our configuration system to make the likelihood of the race condition even lower. Since the race condition had existed in the fleet for several months already, the team believed that this extra step made the risk even lower. Thus the team believed the lowest-risk path, especially given the proximity to BFCM, was to roll out fixes in a controlled manner as opposed to a same-day emergency patch.\nWe developed two mitigations: patch A closed the race condition itself; and patch B added additional input validation to the binary receiving the configuration to prevent it from accepting the new configuration, even if the race condition occurred.\nBoth patches were ready and verified to fix the problem by 13 November. Gradual rollouts of both patches started on Monday, 15 November, and patch B completed rollout by that evening. On Tuesday, 16 November, as the patch A rollout was within 30 minutes of completing, the race condition did manifest in an unpatched cluster, and the outage started.\nAdditionally, even though patch B did protect against the kind of input errors observed during testing, the actual race condition produced a different form of error in the configuration, which the completed rollout of patch B did not prevent from being accepted.\nOnce the root cause was identified, our engineers mitigated the issue by restoring a known-good configuration, and completed and verified the fix, which eliminates the risk of recurrence.\n## Service(s) Affected:\n- Google Cloud Networking: Customer HTTP/S endpoints served 404 error pages. During partial recovery, traffic was served, but customers were unable to make changes to their load balancer configurations.\n- GCLB can be used to load balance traffic to a number of other Google Cloud services, which lost traffic because of the outage. Customers who use serverless network endpoint groups on GCLB as a frontend to Google Cloud Run, Google App Engine, Google App Engine Flex, or Google Cloud Functions received 404 errors when attempting to access their service. Customers using Apigee, Firebase, or Google App Engine Flex received 404 errors when attempting to access their service.\n## Zone(s) Affected:\nGlobal\n## How Customers Experienced the Issue:\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, most endpoints served by global GCLB load balancers returned a 404 error. For an additional 1 hour and 20 minutes, customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration.\n## Workaround(s):\nNone.\nService was restored on 16 November 2021 at 11:28 PT, and the Google Cloud Status Dashboard was updated by 12:08 PT to reflect this.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe have fixed the underlying bug and are taking the following actions to prevent recurrence:\nWe immediately added additional alerting, which will notify us to similar issues significantly faster going forward.\nWe are adding safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. These safeguards provide strengthened automated correctness-checking to configurations before they are applied.\nWe are accelerating planned architectural changes that will improve how we isolate and resolve such issues in the future.",

      "text": "## INCIDENT REPORT\n## Introduction\nWe apologize for any impact the service disruption on Tuesday, 16 November 2021, may have had on your organization. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve the issue.\nWe want to share some information about what happened and the steps we are taking to ensure this issue doesn’t occur again. We also want to assure you that this service disruption does not have any bearing on our preparedness or platform reliability going into Black Friday/Cyber Monday (BFCM).\n## Incident Summary\nOn Tuesday, 16 November 2021 at 09:35 PT, Google Cloud Networking experienced issues with the Google External Proxy Load Balancing (GCLB) service. Affected customers received Google 404 errors in response to HTTP/S requests.\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via automated alerting at 09:50 PT, which aligned with incoming customer support requests, and we immediately started to mitigate the issue by rolling back to the last known good configuration.\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, customers affected by the outage may have encountered 404 errors when accessing any web page (URL) served by Google External Proxy Load Balancing.\nA rollback to the last known good configuration completed at 10:08 PT, which resolved the 404 errors. To avoid the risk of a recurrence, our engineers suspended customer-initiated configuration changes in GCLB. As a result, GCLB service customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration between 10:04 and 11:28 PT.\nDuring the change suspension period, we validated the fix to safeguard against recurrence and deployed additional proctoring and monitoring to ensure safe resumption of service.\nBy 11:28 PT, customer configuration pushes resumed, and normal service was restored. The total duration of impact was 1 hour and 53 minutes.\n## Root Cause\nThis incident was caused by a bug in the configuration pipeline that propagates customer configuration rules to GCLB. The bug was introduced 6 months ago and allowed a race condition (when behavior depends on the timing of data accesses) that would, in very rare cases, push a corrupted configuration file to GCLB. The GCLB update pipeline contains extensive validation checks to prevent corrupt configurations, but the race condition was one that could corrupt the file near the end of the pipeline.\nA Google engineer discovered this bug on 12 November, which caused us to declare an internal high-priority incident because of the latent risk to production systems. After analyzing the bug, we froze a part of our configuration system to make the likelihood of the race condition even lower. Since the race condition had existed in the fleet for several months already, the team believed that this extra step made the risk even lower. Thus the team believed the lowest-risk path, especially given the proximity to BFCM, was to roll out fixes in a controlled manner as opposed to a same-day emergency patch.\nWe developed two mitigations: patch A closed the race condition itself; and patch B added additional input validation to the binary receiving the configuration to prevent it from accepting the new configuration, even if the race condition occurred.\nBoth patches were ready and verified to fix the problem by 13 November. Gradual rollouts of both patches started on Monday, 15 November, and patch B completed rollout by that evening. On Tuesday, 16 November, as the patch A rollout was within 30 minutes of completing, the race condition did manifest in an unpatched cluster, and the outage started.\nAdditionally, even though patch B did protect against the kind of input errors observed during testing, the actual race condition produced a different form of error in the configuration, which the completed rollout of patch B did not prevent from being accepted.\nOnce the root cause was identified, our engineers mitigated the issue by restoring a known-good configuration, and completed and verified the fix, which eliminates the risk of recurrence.\n## Service(s) Affected:\n- Google Cloud Networking: Customer HTTP/S endpoints served 404 error pages. During partial recovery, traffic was served, but customers were unable to make changes to their load balancer configurations.\n- GCLB can be used to load balance traffic to a number of other Google Cloud services, which lost traffic because of the outage. Customers who use serverless network endpoint groups on GCLB as a frontend to Google Cloud Run, Google App Engine, Google App Engine Flex, or Google Cloud Functions received 404 errors when attempting to access their service. Customers using Apigee, Firebase, or Google App Engine Flex received 404 errors when attempting to access their service.\n## Zone(s) Affected:\nGlobal\n## How Customers Experienced the Issue:\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, most endpoints served by global GCLB load balancers returned a 404 error. For an additional 1 hour and 20 minutes, customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration.\n## Workaround(s):\nNone.\nService was restored on 16 November 2021 at 11:28 PT, and the Google Cloud Status Dashboard was updated by 12:08 PT to reflect this.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe have fixed the underlying bug and are taking the following actions to prevent recurrence:\nWe immediately added additional alerting, which will notify us to similar issues significantly faster going forward.\nWe are adding safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. These safeguards provide strengthened automated correctness-checking to configurations before they are applied.\nWe are accelerating planned architectural changes that will improve how we isolate and resolve such issues in the future.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was caused by a new infrastructure feature triggering a latent issue within internal network load balancer code.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Cloud Console - Affected customers in Europe were unable to load the console, or experienced timeouts.\n* Container Registry - Affected customers were unable to connect to the service using the API in europe-west1.\n* Cloud Bigtable - Affected customers in Europe experienced unavailable errors and latency for both data and admin operations.\n* Cloud Spanner - Affected customers in Europe experienced unavailable errors and latency for both data and admin operations.\n* Cloud Endpoints - Service was unavailable in europe-west1 and europe-west4.\n* Firebase Messaging - Affected customers experienced issues receiving notifications in asia-southeast1.\n* Cloud SQL - Affected customers experienced probe creation request failures in europe-west1, europe-west4, and europe-west5.\n* Cloud Eventarc - Affected customers were unable to create triggers in europe-west1.\nApp Engine - Affected customers experienced elevated errors in europe-west1.\n**Additional details:**\nThe error was caught within 4 minutes by automated safety systems, and further spread was slowed at this point. The issue was fully mitigated approximately 1hr 44m later, when our engineering team completed a rollout to disable the vulnerable code path. The issue will be fully prevented going forward via a root cause fix, which will complete rollout by 12 November 2021 21:00 US/Pacific.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was caused by a new infrastructure feature triggering a latent issue within internal network load balancer code.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Cloud Console - Affected customers in Europe were unable to load the console, or experienced timeouts.\n* Container Registry - Affected customers were unable to connect to the service using the API in europe-west1.\n* Cloud Bigtable - Affected customers in Europe experienced unavailable errors and latency for both data and admin operations.\n* Cloud Spanner - Affected customers in Europe experienced unavailable errors and latency for both data and admin operations.\n* Cloud Endpoints - Service was unavailable in europe-west1 and europe-west4.\n* Firebase Messaging - Affected customers experienced issues receiving notifications in asia-southeast1.\n* Cloud SQL - Affected customers experienced probe creation request failures in europe-west1, europe-west4, and europe-west5.\n* Cloud Eventarc - Affected customers were unable to create triggers in europe-west1.\n* App Engine - Affected customers experienced elevated errors in europe-west1.\n**Additional details:**\nThe error was caught within 4 minutes by automated safety systems, and further spread was slowed at this point. The issue was fully mitigated approximately 1hr 44m later, when our engineering team completed a rollout to disable the vulnerable code path. The issue will be fully prevented going forward via a root cause fix, which will complete rollout by 12 November 2021 21:00 US/Pacific.",

We apologize for the inconvenience and are taking steps toward preventing recurrence in the future.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Monitoring is a global service but is subdivided into internal locales, each of which collect monitoring data which is generated locally. When users query Cloud Monitoring, each query fans out through a series of nodes (called mixers) within the corresponding locales. The mixers reach out to source nodes to gather the appropriate data, temporarily retaining it within a limited set of memory.\nDuring a recent infrastructure change in the U.S. locale, the amount of memory allocated to mixers in the us-central1 region was inadvertently reduced. This caused mixer tasks to run low on memory. The number of tasks in a low memory state grew over a period of several days as the change was gradually rolled out to production, following Google's standard progressive rollout policies.\nThe mixer task has safeguards which are designed to detect and reduce the impact of low memory conditions by pausing queries that use significant memory. However, in this case, an existing misconfiguration of this safeguard prevented it from activating correctly. Eventually, tasks which were low on memory failed; enough tasks failed in total to cause widespread failures and service impact.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the problem on 19 October 2021 at 11:11 and immediately started an investigation. Root cause - the reduction in memory allocation for mixer nodes - was identified at 11:32. Google engineers quickly identified a mitigation, which we began to roll out at 11:50. Restoring the proper memory capacity for mixer nodes fully mitigated the issue at 12:54.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions.\nWe are taking the following immediate steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n- Fixing the misconfiguration so that mixers which are low on memory will correctly detect that condition.\n- Introduce load-shedding, such that mixers which run out of memory will simply reject new queries until memory usage subsides, rather than failing.\n- Optimize the mixers to reduce the likelihood of out-of-memory scenarios.\n- Modifying Cloud Monitoring's rollout automation so that it automatically spots problems of this type, allowing engineers to be alerted sooner.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to resource contention that occurred following a recent roll out which included a misconfiguration. Engineers corrected the configuration, and restarted the affected instances to resolve the issue.\n**Customer Impact:**\n-Customers may have experienced errors or incomplete monitoring data.\n-Missing precomputed data from between 11:00 PT and 12:45 PT is expected, but can still be viewed via raw query.\n-Customers may have also experienced false alerts during the impact window based on the underlying monitoring data.",

The issue persisted for 11 hours, 20 minutes.\nAll customers in the United States who use credit card billing were inadvertently notified via email “Your payment information could not be processed. Visit the payment overview page to make sure your payment information is up to date and to pay any outstanding charges.” Customers also received a notification alert in the Google Cloud Console to update their primary payment method. After customers attempted to update their payment information in the admin console, they received a message that the payment could not be processed.\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the incorrect notification to our customers. Our engineering team has deployed a fix for this and has ensured that account settings are restored. We are taking additional steps to prevent similar problems in the future, as outlined below.\nRoot Cause\nThe trigger for this service disruption was an update to the payment configuration intended to support virtual credit cards (one-time credit card numbers from Visa and MasterCard). This update unintentionally caused a situation in which no credit card payments were able to be processed in the U.S. region and resulted in payment failure notifications being sent out to affected customers. Google's standard change control policy is to roll out all production updates progressively; however, in this specific case, errors in the rollout process meant that the change rolled out much more rapidly. Addressing this is a key part of our corrective actions.\nRemediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on 22 September 2021 15:28 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified an unexpected increase of payment request failures and initiated a rollback of the configuration change at 17:42, which resolved the issue causing the incorrect email notifications as well as the Cloud Console alert notifications.\nOnce it was confirmed that affected customers were no longer prompted with the notification alert and impact had ended, engineers began mitigation work to update account state back to the proper payment settings to prevent a recurrence.\nTo prevent recurrence and reduce the impact of similar events, we are taking the following actions:\nImproving our payments infrastructure monitoring and alerting configuration with “early indicator” signals for faster detection and notification of widespread payment failures.\nSpeeding up payment system mitigation procedures by automating the root causing of problems, and increasing the rate at which recovery steps can be processed.\nEnsuring that the class of change which resulted in this incident is pushed progressively, with time to detect adverse impact at small scope.\nDetailed Description of Impact\n#### Google Cloud Console - Google Cloud Platform and Geo Maps\nU.S. customer accounts received an alert notification in their admin account warning that they needed to verify their payment method. When attempting to update the preferred credit card method, the user interface was unresponsive.\nCustomers received an email warning message informing them they needed to verify their payment method. They also might have received an email warning that their project was going to be suspended. After the issue was resolved, account alert notifications disappeared, and the account state was set back to the proper payments setting. Some customers may have observed restrictions and were unable to create new resources. These restrictions were corrected when the account was returned to good standing.\nThe period of impact was between 14:10 and 00:30.\n#### Google Admin Console - Google Workspace\nU.S. customer accounts received an alert notification in their admin account warning that they needed to verify their payment method. When attempting to update the preferred credit card method, the user interface was unresponsive.\nCustomers received an email warning they needed to verify their payment method. When they attempted to update the credit card they are currently using, they were unable to do so. After the issue was resolved, account alert notifications disappeared, and the account state was set back to the proper payments setting.\nThe period of impact was between 14:10 and 01:30.\nAdditional Information for Customers\nThe impacted geographical scope used in the preliminary incident statement was incorrect. While impact initially was suspected to be global, our engineers confirmed impact only affected U.S. customers with credit cards stored for automatic payments. The corrected details for impacted regions / zones are contained in the above report.",

Addressing this is a key part of our corrective actions.\nRemediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on 22 September 2021 15:28 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified an unexpected increase of payment request failures and initiated a rollback of the configuration change at 17:42, which resolved the issue causing the incorrect email notifications as well as the Cloud Console alert notifications.\nOnce it was confirmed that affected customers were no longer prompted with the notification alert and impact had ended, engineers began mitigation work to update account state back to the proper payment settings to prevent a recurrence.\nTo prevent recurrence and reduce the impact of similar events, we are taking the following actions:\nImproving our payments infrastructure monitoring and alerting configuration with “early indicator” signals for faster detection and notification of widespread payment failures.\nSpeeding up payment system mitigation procedures by automating the root causing of problems, and increasing the rate at which recovery steps can be processed.\nEnsuring that the class of change which resulted in this incident is pushed progressively, with time to detect adverse impact at small scope.\nDetailed Description of Impact\n#### Google Cloud Console - Google Cloud Platform and Geo Maps\nU.S. customer accounts received an alert notification in their admin account warning that they needed to verify their payment method. When attempting to update the preferred credit card method, the user interface was unresponsive.\nCustomers received an email warning message informing them they needed to verify their payment method. They also might have received an email warning that their project was going to be suspended. After the issue was resolved, account alert notifications disappeared, and the account state was set back to the proper payments setting. Some customers may have observed restrictions and were unable to create new resources. These restrictions were corrected when the account was returned to good standing.\nThe period of impact was between 14:10 and 00:30.\n#### Google Admin Console - Google Workspace\nU.S. customer accounts received an alert notification in their admin account warning that they needed to verify their payment method. When attempting to update the preferred credit card method, the user interface was unresponsive.\nCustomers received an email warning they needed to verify their payment method. When they attempted to update the credit card they are currently using, they were unable to do so. After the issue was resolved, account alert notifications disappeared, and the account state was set back to the proper payments setting.\nThe period of impact was between 14:10 and 01:30.\nAdditional Information for Customers\nThe impacted geographical scope used in the preliminary incident statement was incorrect. While impact initially was suspected to be global, our engineers confirmed impact only affected U.S. customers with credit cards stored for automatic payments. The corrected details for impacted regions / zones are contained in the above report.",

Additional Cloud services that use Cloud Networking experienced similar symptoms. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a sudden redirection of traffic from a datacenter that was experiencing an issue.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Affected customers may have experienced elevated packet loss and latency as their traffic was temporarily redirected.\n- Google Compute Engine instances experienced failed connectivity and packet loss on ingress, egress, and inter-zonal traffic. Autoscaling was also impacted and may have failed to make decisions.\n- Persistent Disk experienced elevated I/O latency on regional and zonal disks\n- Google Kubernetes Engine clusters experienced 30% of zonal and 5% of regional clusters reporting as unhealthy.\n- Google App Engine and Cloud Run served elevated 500 errors within europe-west2.\n- Cloud Bigtable experienced an elevated error rate and latency on operations within europe-west2.\n- Cloud SQL experienced issues connecting to instances in europe-west2. Affected instances may have lost telemetry data, and HA instances failed over if the primary was in the affected zone.\n- Google Cloud Storage experienced elevated read errors of up to 2.3% in europe-west2.\n- Cloud Filestore instances within europe-west2-c may have been unreachable.\n- Cloud MemoryStore instances within europe-west2 may have been unreachable.\n- Cloud Monitoring experienced delayed or missing metrics from resources in the zone.\n- Cloud VPN experienced a short duration where tunnels went down for a short time before being reestablished.",

If you don’t have a VM, you can create an admin workstation at 1.7.1-gke.4 as the temporary VM.\n1)Ensure the VM and the problematic 1.7.2-gke.2 admin workstation are in power off state.\n2)Attach the boot disk of the problematic admin workstation to the VM. The boot disk is the one with the label Hard disk 1.\n3)Mount the boot disk inside the VM. sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot-disk sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/boot-disk, assuming the boot disk is identified as dev/sdc1.\n4)Set the ubuntu user expiration date to unlimited. sudo chroot /mnt/boot-disk chage -M 99999 ubuntu\n5)Shutdown the temporary VM.\n6)Power on the admin workstation. You should be able to SSH to the admin workstation as usual.\n7)[Clean up] Delete the temporary VM.\nNote that this fix will break the CIS benchmark rule[1] 5.4.1.1 Ensure password expiration is 365 days or less.\n[1]https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/on-prem/1.7/concepts/cis-ubuntu-benchmark\nMitigation steps for non admin workstation nodes (including cluster nodes and Seesaw VM):\nLogin onto each node (or use SSH) to run the following command on the node sudo chroot /mnt/boot-disk chage -M 99999 ubuntu\nNote that if the non admin workstation nodes are not SSHable due to the error, you will have to use the mitigation step for admin workstation.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 23 August 2021 19:50\n**Incident End:** 23 August 2021 21:20\n**Duration:** 1 hours, 30 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n- Cloud Networking\n- Cloud L7 and L4 Load balancers\n- Cloud Interconnect\n- Cloud NAT\n- Cloud VPN\n- Google Compute Engine\n- Google Kubernetes Engine\n- Cloud Persistent Disk\n- Cloud Cloud Storage\n- Cloud FileStore\n- Cloud Dataproc\n- Cloud Run\n- Cloud SQL\n- Cloud Spanner\n- Cloud Pub/Sub\n- Cloud Dataflow\n- Cloud Dataproc\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Bigtable\n- Cloud Logging\n- Cloud Monitoring\n- Cloud BigQuery\n- Cloud IAM\n**Regions/Zones:** australia-southeast2\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced intermittent connectivity issues with Google Cloud Services in australia-southeast2 for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The underlying Cloud Networking impact ended at 20:41, however, some Cloud Services took longer to recover - delaying the all clear until 21:20. Any service that uses Cloud Networking may have seen impact. We have included available details of service specific impact below; however, this may not be a comprehensive accounting of all downstream networking impact. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was transient voltage at the feeder to the network equipment, causing the equipment to reboot. In order to mitigate the issue, traffic within the australia-southeast2 region was redirected temporarily.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Cloud Networking: Public IP traffic connectivity failed from 19:51 to 20:41.\n- Cloud L7 Load Balancers: Partial dataplane query loss and control plane operational delay for External load balancers from 19:50 - 20:12, and Internal load balancers from 19:50 - 20:18.\n- Cloud L4 Load Balancing Inbound public IP traffic was dropped from 19:51 to 20:41.\n- Cloud Interconnect: Up to 100% packet loss between 19:50 and 20:21.\n- Cloud NAT experienced control plane failures from 19:51 to 20:00.\n- Cloud VPN HA dropped up to 83% of traffic between 19:51 and 20:21, while Legacy VPN dropped ~100% of traffic between 19:51 and 20:41.\n- Cloud SQL: 100% error rate from 19:49 to 20:01.\n- Cloud Storage: 100% error rate through 21:20.\n- Cloud Functions:\n- Cloud Run: 100% error rate through 21:19.\n- Cloud Bigtable: 100% error rate from 19:49 to 20:01 and increased latency from 20:01 to 20:13.\n- Cloud Logging: Logs written within the region may have failed to be ingested from 20:07 to 21:18.\n- Cloud Monitoring: Customers may have experienced falsely firing alerts, missed alerts, missing metrics and failed writes from 19:50 to 20:15.\n- Google Compute Engine: Operations to create or modify instances failed from 19:52 to 20:12. Connectivity from instances to other GCP services may be affected until 20:26. Existing instances may have lost network connectivity. Additionally autoscaling had delays or errors collecting input data which may have impacted autoscaling decisions.\n- Google Kubernetes Engine: Control plane operations on regional clusters failed between 19:50 and 20:04. Increased latency from 20:05 to 20:41. 100% of requests to container.googleapis.com failed\n- Persistent Disk: Up to 100% device unavailability between 19:51 and 20:13.\n- Cloud Filestore: Up to 100% error rate from 19:50 to 20:03.\n- Cloud IAM: ~80% error rate from 19:52 to 20:10.\n- Cloud Spanner: 100% error rate between 19:53 and 20:09.\n- Cloud Pub/Sub: Increased error rate and latency of up to 95% between 19:50 and 20:12.\n- Cloud Dataflow: Increased errors starting jobs and making progress on existing jobs between 19:50 and 20:12.\n- Cloud Dataproc: New cluster creation failed from 20:09 until 21:20\n- Cloud Firestore: Control Plane saw ~90% error rates from 19:50 to 20:03.

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is due to a configuration change that updated the service agent used when publishing to Pub/Sub. Projects using the new service agent without the correct permissions resulted in PERMISSION_DENIED errors for tasks that required publishing to Pub/Sub.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAll customers with Cloud Scheduler jobs with a Pub/Sub topic as a target that did not grant the Cloud Scheduler Google-managed service account access to that Pub/Sub topic saw PERMISSION_DENIED errors.\n**Additional details:**\nThe issue was fully resolved on 27 July 2021 at 15:28 US/Pacific after a rollback of the change was completed.",

The Cloud Monitoring section in the Cloud Console experienced intermittent errors when loading pages due to the underlying API errors. This included the following pages; Monitoring Homepage, Dashboard Builder, GKE Dashboard, Metrics Explorer, Network Topology, Uptime Checks Service. Additionally, attempting to create the first Cloud EKM key [1] in a project would fail during this period. If a project already has (or at some point had) Cloud EKM keys, they can continue to create keys in those projects and use them. The root cause of the issue is suspected to be the rollout of a permission change which incorrectly restricted access to the underlying database which stores metadata information about the affected APIs.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Cloud Console errors on up to 10% of the listed page loads or equivalent API’s.\n**Additional details:**\n- Workaround: Retrying failed requests with exponential backoff returned successful results for some customers.\n- Workaround: Before attempting to create the first Cloud EKM key, running gcloud beta services identity create --service=cloudkms.googleapis.com --project $KEY_PROJECT_ID” prevented the failure.\n**Reference(s):**\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/services/generateServiceIdentity",

The Cloud Monitoring section in the Cloud Console experienced intermittent errors when loading pages due to the underlying API errors. This included the following pages; Monitoring Homepage, Dashboard Builder, GKE Dashboard, Metrics Explorer, Network Topology, Uptime Checks Service. Additionally, attempting to create the first Cloud EKM key [1] in a project would fail during this period. If a project already has (or at some point had) Cloud EKM keys, they can continue to create keys in those projects and use them. The root cause of the issue is suspected to be the rollout of a permission change which incorrectly restricted access to the underlying database which stores metadata information about the affected APIs.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Cloud Console errors on up to 10% of the listed page loads or equivalent API’s.\n**Additional details:**\n- Workaround: Retrying failed requests with exponential backoff returned successful results for some customers.\n- Workaround: Before attempting to create the first Cloud EKM key, running gcloud beta services identity create --service=cloudkms.googleapis.com --project $KEY_PROJECT_ID” prevented the failure.\n**Reference(s):**\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/services/generateServiceIdentity",

This issue impacted creation of resources that depend on PD-SSD. The root cause of the issue was an unexpected increase in utilization of PD-SSD, which led to unavailability of SSD capacity for some users in the impacted zones.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Compute Engine (GCE) : * Issues with new VM creations as boot disk creations failed. * Auto-scaling of VMs was impacted due to failure with new VM creations. * Intermittent reduction in write throughput. * Issues with expanding SSD-backed device sizes.\n* Cloud Composer: * Failed Cloud Composer environment creations.\n* Cloud SQL: * Intermittent create operation failures. * PD-SSD disk size increases failures.\n* Cloud Build: * Cloud Builds using custom size VMs or using workerpools experienced failures.\n* Google Kubernetes Engine: * Intermittent issues with cluster creation. * Intermittent issues with creation and scaling of node pools with PD-SSD nodes.\n* Dataproc/Dataflow: * Dataproc cluster creation and Dataflow jobs may have failed due to underlying errors regarding disk creation failures.\n**Additional details:**\nTo prevent unexpected spike in utilization from impacting PD-SSD capacity availability, the following actions and safety measures were implemented:\n* Engineering team has identified and throttled the source of the unexpected spike in PD-SSD utilization.\n* Additional SSD capacity added for higher tolerance to spikes in utilization.\n* Increased rebalancing to make additional SSD capacity available.",

This issue impacted creation of resources that depend on PD-SSD. The root cause of the issue was an unexpected increase in utilization of PD-SSD, which led to unavailability of SSD capacity for some users in the impacted zones.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Compute Engine (GCE) : * Issues with new VM creations as boot disk creations failed. * Auto-scaling of VMs was impacted due to failure with new VM creations. * Intermittent reduction in write throughput. * Issues with expanding SSD-backed device sizes.\n* Cloud Composer: * Failed Cloud Composer environment creations.\n* Cloud SQL: * Intermittent create operation failures. * PD-SSD disk size increases failures.\n* Cloud Build: * Cloud Builds using custom size VMs or using workerpools experienced failures.\n* Google Kubernetes Engine: * Intermittent issues with cluster creation. * Intermittent issues with creation and scaling of node pools with PD-SSD nodes.\n* Dataproc/Dataflow: * Dataproc cluster creation and Dataflow jobs may have failed due to underlying errors regarding disk creation failures.\n**Additional details:**\nTo prevent unexpected spike in utilization from impacting PD-SSD capacity availability, the following actions and safety measures were implemented:\n* Engineering team has identified and throttled the source of the unexpected spike in PD-SSD utilization.\n* Additional SSD capacity added for higher tolerance to spikes in utilization.\n* Increased rebalancing to make additional SSD capacity available.",
