        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nStarting on Monday, 9 December 2024 09:24 US/Pacific, some Google BigQuery customers in the US multi-region encountered failures on 80-90% of requests to the insertAll API, with a ‘5xx’ error code along with increased latency. BigQuery Write API customers also saw an increase in latency for some requests during this time. Also, Dataflow customers may have experienced an increase in latency by 5-15%. The impact lasted for a duration of 2 hours and 16 minutes.\nTo our BigQuery and Dataflow customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nDataflow depends on BigQuery to write streaming data to a table. BigQuery uses a streaming backend service to persist data. This streaming backend service in one of the clusters in the US multi-region experienced a high number of concurrent connections caused by a slightly higher than usual customer traffic fluctuation. This backend service enforces a limit on the number of such concurrent connections for flow control and a bug in its mechanism prevented backends from accepting new requests once this limit was reached.\nDue to reduced bandwidth in the backend servers in the cluster, the regional streaming frontends experienced higher latency and started accumulating more inflight requests. This led to their overload and regional impact to BigQuery and Dataflow streaming customers outside the affected cluster.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage by our internal monitoring system on Monday, 9 December 2024 at 09:33 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nAfter a thorough investigation, the impacted backend cluster was identified. Initial mitigation attempt focused on reducing server load through traffic throttling. To achieve complete mitigation, our engineers then drained the affected cluster, resulting in immediate and complete recovery.\nGoogle is committed to preventing this issue from repeating in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Fix the root cause in the backend service to handle surges in concurrent connections and avoid zonal impact.\n* Improve testing coverage of the backend service to prevent similar issues.\n* Enhance the ability to detect and automatically mitigate similar cases of zonal impact.\n* Improve isolation to prevent issues in a particular cluster or availability zone from impacting all users in the region.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday 9 December 2024 from 09:24 to 11:40 US/Pacific BigQuery and Dataflow customers experienced increased latency and elevated error rates in US multi-region.\n### Google BigQuery\n* 80-90% of all requests for the insertAll API failed with a ‘5xx’ status code in US multi-region. Tail latency also increased substantially from <100ms to ~30 seconds during this time.\n* Additionally, AppendRows requests for the Write API saw increased tail latency (99.99%) from <3 seconds to ~30 seconds during this time.\n### Cloud Dataflow\n* 5-15% of Dataflow streaming jobs may have experienced increased latency in us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west2 and us-central1 regions for the duration of the incident.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 9 December 2024 09:24\n**Incident End:** 9 December 2024 11:40\n**Duration:** 2 hours, 24 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle BigQuery\nCloud Dataflow\n**Regions/Zones:**\n* Google BigQuery - US multi-region\n* Cloud Dataflow - us-west1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west2 & us-central1 were the most impacted but all Dataflow pipelines writing to the BigQuery US multi-region have likely been impacted too.\n**Description:**\nGoogle BigQuery experienced increased latency and elevated error rates in US multi-region for a duration of 2 hours, 24 minutes. Cloud Dataflow customers also observed elevated latency in their streaming jobs to the BigQuery US multi-region. Preliminary analysis indicates that the root cause of the issue was a sudden burst of traffic, which overloaded and slowed the backend in the availability zone. This led to aggressive retries and overloaded the frontend service. The incident was mitigated by rate-limiting requests and by evacuating the slow availability zone.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n### Google BigQuery\n* During the incident, customers calling google.cloud.bigquery.v2.TableDataService.InsertAll API method may have experienced transient failures with 5XX status code, which should have succeeded after retries.\n* Customers using google.cloud.bigquery.storage.v1.AppendRows may have experienced increased latency during this incident.\n### Cloud Dataflow\n* Customers would have experienced increased latency for streaming jobs in the us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west2, and us-central1 regions.",

BigQuery Write API customers also saw an increase in latency for some requests during this time. Also, Dataflow customers may have experienced an increase in latency by 5-15%.

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nStarting on 4 December 2024 at 14:30 US/Pacific, Google BigQuery experienced elevated invalid value and internal system errors globally for traffic related to BigQuery and Google Drive integration for 3 hours and 25 minutes. The incident affected users and tasks attempting to export data to Google Drive, resulting in failed export jobs.\nThe impacted users would have encountered “API key not valid” and “Failed to read the spreadsheet” errors for export jobs when accessing Google Drive. This resulted in service unavailability or failing jobs for the duration of this disruption for Google BigQuery.\nTo our BigQuery customers whose business analytics were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThis disruption of data export functionality was triggered by the deletion of an internal project containing essential API keys. This deletion was an unintended consequence of several contributing factors:\n- An internally used API key was flagged for a Google policy non-compliance and deemed no longer in use which led to the deleting of the API key.\n- Unclear Internal Google Project Ownership: The project ownership was not clearly recorded, and thus incorrectly associated with a deprecated service.\n- Outdated Information: The combination of the perceived lack of recent activity and the incorrect ownership led to the project being mistakenly classified as abandoned and deprecated.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the service degrading via a support case on 4 December 2024, at approximately 14:21 US/Pacific when users began experiencing failures in data export operations. Google Engineers were alerted to the service disruption through internal monitoring systems and user reports. Upon investigation, the deletion of the project was identified as the root cause.\nTo mitigate the impact, the project was restored at approximately 15:45 US/Pacific. This action successfully recovered the API keys and over time restored the data export functionality for all affected users. The final error related to this incident was observed at approximately 17:55 US/Pacific, indicating full service recovery.\nGoogle is committed to continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused and appreciate your understanding.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions.\n- **Remove dependency on API keys for BigQuery integrations with other Google services:** This will eliminate the entire failure mode.\n- **Implement accidental deletion protection for critical internal resources:** Use mechanisms like project liens to ensure that a critical resource cannot be deleted accidentally.\n- **Enhance Project Metadata:** We are implementing a process for regular review and validation of project ownership and metadata. This will ensure that critical information about project usage and status is accurate and up-to-date, reducing the risk of incorrect assumptions about project status.\n- **Strengthen Internal Processes and Access Controls:** We are strengthening our processes for deprecating and deleting projects, including mandatory reviews, impact assessments, and stakeholder approvals. This will prevent accidental deletion of critical projects and ensure that all potential impacts are thoroughly evaluated before any action is taken. We are also strengthening access controls for project deletion, ensuring that only authorized personnel with appropriate approvals can perform this action. This will add an additional layer of protection against unintended project deletion.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting on 4 December 2024, Google BigQuery experienced elevated error rates for data export operations to Google Drive globally. Between approximately 14:21 and 18:04 US/Pacific, users attempting to export data from BigQuery to Google Drive encountered failures, resulting in service disruption for this specific functionality.\nThe incident affected all regions and impacted users encountered errors such as \"API key not valid,\" \"Failed to read the spreadsheet,\" or \"[Error: 80324028]\". Internal error messages further specified the issue as \"Dremel returned third-party error from GDRIVE: FAILED_PRECONDITION: Encountered an error while creating temporary directory\" with an underlying status of \"Http(400) Bad Request, API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key.\"\n### Google BigQuery\nThis disruption specifically impacted users and automated tasks relying on the BigQuery to Google Drive export functionality. Export jobs initiated during this period failed to complete, preventing data transfer and potentially impacting downstream processes and workflows dependent on this data.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nStarting on 4 December 2024 at 14:30 US/Pacific, Google BigQuery experienced elevated invalid value and internal system errors globally for traffic related to BigQuery and Google Drive integration for 3 hours and 25 minutes. The incident affected users and tasks attempting to export data to Google Drive, resulting in failed export jobs.\nThe impacted users would have encountered “API key not valid” and “Failed to read the spreadsheet” errors for export jobs when accessing Google Drive. This resulted in service unavailability or failing jobs for the duration of this disruption for Google BigQuery.\nTo our BigQuery customers whose business analytics were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThis disruption of data export functionality was triggered by the deletion of an internal project containing essential API keys. This deletion was an unintended consequence of several contributing factors:\n- An internally used API key was flagged for a Google policy non-compliance and deemed no longer in use which led to the deleting of the API key.\n- Unclear Internal Google Project Ownership: The project ownership was not clearly recorded, and thus incorrectly associated with a deprecated service.\n- Outdated Information: The combination of the perceived lack of recent activity and the incorrect ownership led to the project being mistakenly classified as abandoned and deprecated.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the service degrading via a support case on 4 December 2024, at approximately 14:21 US/Pacific when users began experiencing failures in data export operations. Google Engineers were alerted to the service disruption through internal monitoring systems and user reports. Upon investigation, the deletion of the project was identified as the root cause.\nTo mitigate the impact, the project was restored at approximately 15:45 US/Pacific. This action successfully recovered the API keys and over time restored the data export functionality for all affected users. The final error related to this incident was observed at approximately 17:55 US/Pacific, indicating full service recovery.\nGoogle is committed to continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused and appreciate your understanding.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions.\n- **Remove dependency on API keys for BigQuery integrations with other Google services:** This will eliminate the entire failure mode.\n- **Implement accidental deletion protection for critical internal resources:** Use mechanisms like project liens to ensure that a critical resource cannot be deleted accidentally.\n- **Enhance Project Metadata:** We are implementing a process for regular review and validation of project ownership and metadata. This will ensure that critical information about project usage and status is accurate and up-to-date, reducing the risk of incorrect assumptions about project status.\n- **Strengthen Internal Processes and Access Controls:** We are strengthening our processes for deprecating and deleting projects, including mandatory reviews, impact assessments, and stakeholder approvals. This will prevent accidental deletion of critical projects and ensure that all potential impacts are thoroughly evaluated before any action is taken. We are also strengthening access controls for project deletion, ensuring that only authorized personnel with appropriate approvals can perform this action. This will add an additional layer of protection against unintended project deletion.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting on 4 December 2024, Google BigQuery experienced elevated error rates for data export operations to Google Drive globally. Between approximately 14:21 and 18:04 US/Pacific, users attempting to export data from BigQuery to Google Drive encountered failures, resulting in service disruption for this specific functionality.\nThe incident affected all regions and impacted users encountered errors such as \"API key not valid,\" \"Failed to read the spreadsheet,\" or \"[Error: 80324028]\". Internal error messages further specified the issue as \"Dremel returned third-party error from GDRIVE: FAILED_PRECONDITION: Encountered an error while creating temporary directory\" with an underlying status of \"Http(400) Bad Request, API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key.\"\n### Google BigQuery\nThis disruption specifically impacted users and automated tasks relying on the BigQuery to Google Drive export functionality. Export jobs initiated during this period failed to complete, preventing data transfer and potentially impacting downstream processes and workflows dependent on this data.",

The failures were corrected and minimum required capacity recovered by 02:13 US/Pacific.\nTo our GCP customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause and Impact\nGoogle’s global network is designed and built to ensure that any occasional capacity loss events are not noticeable and/or have minimal disruption to customers. We provision several diverse network paths to each region and maintain sufficient capacity buffers based on the measured reliability of capacity in each region.\nBetween 12 November and 16 November, two separate fiber failures occurred near the asia-southeast2 region. These failures temporarily reduced the available network capacity between the asia-southeast2 region and other GCP regions, but did not impact the availability of GCP services in the region. Google engineers were alerted of these failures as soon as they occurred and were working with urgency on remediating these fiber failures but had not yet completed full recovery.\nOn 16 November 2024 at 00:47 US/Pacific, a latent software defect impacted a backbone networking router in the asia-southeast2 region resulting in further reduction of available inter-region capacity and exhausted our reserve network capacity buffers causing multiple Google Cloud services in the region to experience high latency and/or elevated error rates for operations requiring inter-region connectivity. During this time, customers in asia-southeast2, would have experienced issues with managing and monitoring existing resources, creating new resources, and data replication to other regions.\nTo mitigate the impact, Google engineers re-routed Internet traffic away from the asia-southeast2 region to be served from other GCP regions, primarily asia-southeast1 while working in parallel to recover the lost capacity. The faulty backbone networking router was recovered on 16 November 2024 02:13 US/Pacific. This ended the elevated network latency and error rates for most of the impacted GCP services’ operations. Recovery of the first failed fiber was completed on 18 November 08:45 US/Pacific and the second failed fiber was restored at 09:00 US/Pacific on the same day.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe’re taking the following actions to reduce the likelihood of recurrence and time to mitigate impact of this type of incident in the future:\n- During the incident, our actions to reroute traffic away from the asia-southeast2 region and recover the faulty backbone networking router took longer than expected as the loss of capacity hindered our visibility of required networking telemetry and functionality of emergency tooling. We’re reviewing these gaps to implement the required improvements to our network observability, emergency tools and incident response playbooks.\n- Work with our fiber partners in the asia-southeast2 region to ensure our fiber paths between facilities in the region and to submarine cable landing stations are on the most reliable routes available, and have adequate preventative maintenance and repair processes.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 16 November 2024 at 00:47 US/Pacific, a combination of fiber failures and a network equipment fault led to reduced network capacity between the asia-southeast2 region and other GCP regions. The failures were corrected and minimum required capacity recovered by 02:13 US/Pacific.\nTo our GCP customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause and Impact\nGoogle’s global network is designed and built to ensure that any occasional capacity loss events are not noticeable and/or have minimal disruption to customers. We provision several diverse network paths to each region and maintain sufficient capacity buffers based on the measured reliability of capacity in each region.\nBetween 12 November and 16 November, two separate fiber failures occurred near the asia-southeast2 region. These failures temporarily reduced the available network capacity between the asia-southeast2 region and other GCP regions, but did not impact the availability of GCP services in the region. Google engineers were alerted of these failures as soon as they occurred and were working with urgency on remediating these fiber failures but had not yet completed full recovery.\nOn 16 November 2024 at 00:47 US/Pacific, a latent software defect impacted a backbone networking router in the asia-southeast2 region resulting in further reduction of available inter-region capacity and exhausted our reserve network capacity buffers causing multiple Google Cloud services in the region to experience high latency and/or elevated error rates for operations requiring inter-region connectivity. During this time, customers in asia-southeast2, would have experienced issues with managing and monitoring existing resources, creating new resources, and data replication to other regions.\nTo mitigate the impact, Google engineers re-routed Internet traffic away from the asia-southeast2 region to be served from other GCP regions, primarily asia-southeast1 while working in parallel to recover the lost capacity. The faulty backbone networking router was recovered on 16 November 2024 02:13 US/Pacific. This ended the elevated network latency and error rates for most of the impacted GCP services’ operations. Recovery of the first failed fiber was completed on 18 November 08:45 US/Pacific and the second failed fiber was restored at 09:00 US/Pacific on the same day.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe’re taking the following actions to reduce the likelihood of recurrence and time to mitigate impact of this type of incident in the future:\n- During the incident, our actions to reroute traffic away from the asia-southeast2 region and recover the faulty backbone networking router took longer than expected as the loss of capacity hindered our visibility of required networking telemetry and functionality of emergency tooling. We’re reviewing these gaps to implement the required improvements to our network observability, emergency tools and incident response playbooks.\n- Work with our fiber partners in the asia-southeast2 region to ensure our fiber paths between facilities in the region and to submarine cable landing stations are on the most reliable routes available, and have adequate preventative maintenance and repair processes.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 14 November 2024 at 21:57 US/Pacific, our support ticketing system that handles Google Cloud, Billing, and Workspace customer support, experienced an unexpected issue during a vendor-planned maintenance event, causing the system to become unavailable. Throughout the incident duration of 6 hours and 12 minutes, customers were unable to update existing chat, portal or email cases. Customers who attempted to create a support case were presented with our backup contact method and were able to receive support through this method which remained available throughout the outage.\n## Root Cause\nThe outage was triggered by a vendor-initiated change that impacted the performance of our support ticket persistence layer. This update inadvertently caused unavailability, specifically to the query subsystem of our support case management tool. After this configuration change was applied, the subsystem became unresponsive, preventing the processing of any read or write commands. As a result, customers and Google Support were unable to access or update support ticket data, leading to service disruption.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nOur monitoring systems detected elevated error rates and, at 22:09 US/Pacific, alerted our engineering team, who immediately started an investigation with the vendor. The vendor's incident team concluded that the query subsystem state would not be resolved by a configuration rollback. The vendor’s engineering team prepared a new update, validated it in a test environment, and applied the update to production, returning the system to service on 15 November 2024 at 04:09 US/Pacific.\nWe are taking immediate steps with the vendor to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n- A production change freeze for the vendor's query subsystem is in place until rollout safeguards are sufficient to prevent further impact.\n- We are working with the vendor to improve their change management process to ensure safer rollouts that avoid unexpected issues while also providing earlier detection of rollout change.\n- We will perform a review of rollback safety for configuration changes with the vendor to ensure rollback is always possible, reducing recovery time.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting on 14 November 2024 at 21:57 US/Pacific,\n- Customers observed increased latency and required multiple attempts when opening support cases. Customers were able to use the backup case creation process to receive support.\n- Customers were able to send and receive updates to existing support cases by email, but were not able to update cases using the support portal. Support agents were able to send update emails for cases, create pro-active bugs and fill Contact-Us-Forms (CUFs) on behalf of their customers. However, responding via the support portal was unavailable.\n- Customers with active chat support cases were unable to continue their conversation. Error messages received by customers included options for continuing support via the Contact-Us-Forms (CUFs).\n- All contractual obligations for support requests submitted through the Contact-Us-Forms (CUFs) were fulfilled.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 14 November, 2024 21:59\n**Incident End:** 15 November, 2024 04:09\n**Duration:** 6 hours, 10 mins\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Support and Google Workspace Support\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGoogle's Ticketing system, supporting Google Cloud, Billing, and Workspace, experienced an unplanned maintenance event, causing the system to become unavailable. Throughout the 6 hours and 10 minutes, customers were unable to update existing chat, portal, or email cases. Customers who attempted to create a support case were presented with our backup contact method and were able to receive support through the backup method.\nPreliminary analysis finds that a planned change to Google’s support ticket persistence layer caused the primary system for creating and updating support sessions to return errors. Customers attempting to create a support case were directed to retry, then were provided access to our backup support channel, which worked throughout the outage.\nNo other Google Cloud services were impacted.\nThe engineering on-call team rolled back the change to the persistence layer, restoring service.\nWe sincerely apologize to our Google Cloud customers for this recent service disruption.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers saw increased latency and required multiple attempts when opening support cases. Customers were able to use the backup case creation method to receive support.\nCustomers were able to send updates to existing support cases by email, but may not have been able to update using the support portal. Support agents were unable to respond to already-existing cases.\nCustomers with active chat support cases were unable to continue their conversation.",

The impacted network paths were recovered post reboot and connectivity was restored at 16:43 US/Pacific.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platforms’ performance and resilience.\n## Impact\nGCP operates multiple PoPs in the australia-southeast2 region to connect Cloud zones to each other and to Google’s Global Network. Google maintains sufficient capacity to ensure that occasional failures of network capacity are not noticeable and/or have minimal disruption to customers.\nOn Tuesday, 29 October 2024, two fiber failures had occurred near this region. These failures reduced the available inter-region network capacity, but did not impact the availability of GCP services in the region.\nThen later that same day, the PoP where 50% of the network capacity for the region is hosted, experienced a power voltage swell event causing the networking devices in the PoP to reboot. When the networking devices in this datacenter rebooted, this networking capacity was temporarily unavailable.\nThis rare triple failure resulted in reduced connectivity across zones in the region and caused multiple Google Cloud services to lose connectivity for 21 minutes. Additionally, customers using Zones A and Zones C, experienced up to 15% increased latency and error rates for 16 minutes due to degraded inter-zone network connectivity while the networking devices recovered from the reboot .\nGoogle engineers were already working on remediating the two fiber failures when they were alerted to the network disruption caused by the voltage swell via an internal monitoring alert on Tuesday, 29 October 2024 16:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nAfter the devices had completed rebooting, the impacted network paths were recovered and all affected Cloud Zones regained full connectivity to the network at 16:43 US/Pacific.\nMajority of GCP services impacted by the issue recovered shortly thereafter. A few Cloud services experienced longer restoration times as manual actions were required in some cases to complete full recovery.\n**(Updated on 04 December 2024\\)**\n## Root cause of device reboots\nUpon review of the power management systems, Google engineers have determined there is a mismatch in voltage tolerances in the affected network equipment on the site. The affected network racks are currently designed to tolerate up to \\~110% of designed voltage, but the UPS which supplies the power to the network equipment is designed to tolerate up to \\~120% of designed voltage.\nThe voltage swell event caused a deviation between 110% and 120% which was detected by the networking equipment's rectifiers as outside their allowable range and they powered down in order to protect the equipment.\nWe have determined that a voltage regulator for the datacenter-level UPS was enabled, which is a standard setting. This caused an additional boost during power fluctuations, pushing the voltage into the problematic 110%-120% range. The voltage regulator is necessary to ensure sufficient voltage when loads are high, but because the equipment is well below its load limit, and caused a deviation above expected levels.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe are taking the following actions to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n* Review our datacenter power distribution design in the region and implement any recommended additional protections for critical networking devices against voltage swells and sags.\n* As an initial risk reduction measure, the datacenter-level UPS voltage regulator will be reconfigured, and we have instituted monthly reviews to ensure it will be configured to correctly match future site load.\n* We are also deploying a double conversion UPS in the affected datacenter's power distribution design for the equipment that failed during this event.\n* Implement changes to network device configuration that reduce time to recover full network connectivity after a failure.\n* Review and verify that this risk does not exist in other locations, and if so proactively perform the above remediations.\n* Root cause and determine corrective actions for GCP Services that did not recover quickly from the incident after the network connectivity was restored.\n----\nTo summarize, the root cause investigation for the network device reboots impacting the australia-southeast2 region has been concluded. Google teams are implementing additional preventative measures to minimize the risk of recurrence.\nThis is the final version of the Incident Report.\n----",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Tuesday, 29 October 2024 at 16:21 US/Pacific, a power voltage swell event impacted the Network Point of Presence (POP) infrastructure in one of the campuses supporting the australia-southeast2 region, causing networking devices to unexpectedly reboot. The impacted network paths were recovered post reboot and connectivity was restored at 16:43 US/Pacific.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platforms’ performance and resilience.\n## Impact\nGCP operates multiple PoPs in the australia-southeast2 region to connect Cloud zones to each other and to Google’s Global Network. Google maintains sufficient capacity to ensure that occasional failures of network capacity are not noticeable and/or have minimal disruption to customers.\nOn Tuesday, 29 October 2024, two fiber failures had occurred near this region. These failures reduced the available inter-region network capacity, but did not impact the availability of GCP services in the region.\nThen later that same day, the PoP where 50% of the network capacity for the region is hosted, experienced a power voltage swell event causing the networking devices in the PoP to reboot. When the networking devices in this datacenter rebooted, this networking capacity was temporarily unavailable.\nThis rare triple failure resulted in reduced connectivity across zones in the region and caused multiple Google Cloud services to lose connectivity for 21 minutes. Additionally, customers using Zones A and Zones C, experienced up to 15% increased latency and error rates for 16 minutes due to degraded inter-zone network connectivity while the networking devices recovered from the reboot .\nGoogle engineers were already working on remediating the two fiber failures when they were alerted to the network disruption caused by the voltage swell via an internal monitoring alert on Tuesday, 29 October 2024 16:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nAfter the devices had completed rebooting, the impacted network paths were recovered and all affected Cloud Zones regained full connectivity to the network at 16:43 US/Pacific.\nMajority of GCP services impacted by the issue recovered shortly thereafter. A few Cloud services experienced longer restoration times as manual actions were required in some cases to complete full recovery.\n**(Updated on 04 December 2024\\)**\n## Root cause of device reboots\nUpon review of the power management systems, Google engineers have determined there is a mismatch in voltage tolerances in the affected network equipment on the site. The affected network racks are currently designed to tolerate up to \\~110% of designed voltage, but the UPS which supplies the power to the network equipment is designed to tolerate up to \\~120% of designed voltage.\nThe voltage swell event caused a deviation between 110% and 120% which was detected by the networking equipment's rectifiers as outside their allowable range and they powered down in order to protect the equipment.\nWe have determined that a voltage regulator for the datacenter-level UPS was enabled, which is a standard setting. This caused an additional boost during power fluctuations, pushing the voltage into the problematic 110%-120% range. The voltage regulator is necessary to ensure sufficient voltage when loads are high, but because the equipment is well below its load limit, and caused a deviation above expected levels.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe are taking the following actions to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n* Review our datacenter power distribution design in the region and implement any recommended additional protections for critical networking devices against voltage swells and sags.\n* As an initial risk reduction measure, the datacenter-level UPS voltage regulator will be reconfigured, and we have instituted monthly reviews to ensure it will be configured to correctly match future site load.\n* We are also deploying a double conversion UPS in the affected datacenter's power distribution design for the equipment that failed during this event.\n* Implement changes to network device configuration that reduce time to recover full network connectivity after a failure.\n* Review and verify that this risk does not exist in other locations, and if so proactively perform the above remediations.\n* Root cause and determine corrective actions for GCP Services that did not recover quickly from the incident after the network connectivity was restored.\n----\nTo summarize, the root cause investigation for the network device reboots impacting the australia-southeast2 region has been concluded. Google teams are implementing additional preventative measures to minimize the risk of recurrence.\nThis is the final version of the Incident Report.\n----",

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Build uses an internal component that manages the execution of the builds by using transient worker Google Compute Engine (GCE) virtual machine (VM) instances. Each machine is only used for execution of one build and deleted after that.\nThe root cause of the issue is Cloud Build's failure to degrade gracefully upon being throttled by its GCE API quota in the us-central1 region. As a result of being throttled, the Cloud Build component responsible for managing worker pools initiated multiple retries due to an incorrect configuration, further exacerbating the quota exhaustion and completely preventing the creation of new worker instances in the region. This effectively halted build processing in the us-central1 region, leading to a regional outage.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage from an internal monitoring alert at 02:31 US/Pacific on Friday 25 October, 2024 and immediately started an investigation.\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers tuned retry settings by 06:40 US/Pacific to bring calls to the GCE API to sustainable levels. This ensured the requests were no longer throttled and the internal system was able to create worker VM instances again to execute new builds and process the backlog. Subsequently at 08:47 the backlog queue dropped to normal levels.\nGoogle engineers proactively increased the quota at 09:43 US/Pacific to ensure this incident does not immediately reoccur.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- We are improving the mechanism which Cloud Build creates and deletes GCE worker VMs to ensure graceful degradation of service in case of errors.\n- We are conducting a thorough investigation of internal quotas in all regions to ensure that we have enough capacity to execute builds from all customers at peak traffic.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Cloud Build\nDuring the period of impact, customers’ would have noticed that all the builds (both created manually and scheduled by build triggers) in the us-central1 region were being queued but not executed, and appeared as stuck.\nOnce the incident was resolved, all builds that had exceeded the amount of time they could be queued got marked as expired. The remaining ones were eventually executed but with a delay.\n### Google Cloud Deploy\nCustomers were able to create new releases and rollouts (whether initiated manually or through automation), however the resources became stuck in an 'in-progress' state. Essentially, the Cloud Deploy service was not operational in the us-central1 region, as no deployments were being executed.\n### Google App Engine (GAE)\nGAE version deployments in the us-central1 region saw elevated latency in its execution or failed with an “INTERNAL” error. Request traffic to existing GAE versions was not impacted by this incident.\n### Google Cloud functions\nCustomers would have seen elevated “RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED” errors or elevated latency for the create and update operations in the us-central1 region for Cloud Run functions. Request traffic to existing Cloud Run functions (1st and 2nd Gen) was not impacted by this incident.\n### Google Cloud Run\nA few customers deploying source code to Cloud Run in the us-central1 region experienced increased deployment latency of deployment failures with an “INTERNAL” error.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 25 October, 2024 02:15\n**Incident End:** 25 October, 2024 08:03\n**Duration:** 5 hours, 48 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n* Cloud Build\n* Cloud Deploy\n**Regions/Zones:** us-central1\n**Description:**\nCloud Build and Cloud Deploy customers in the us-central1 region experienced a service disruption lasting 5 hours and 48 minutes. During this time, 100% of builds were either stuck in the queued phase and subsequently expired, or faced significant execution delays. The root cause was identified as a bug in how Cloud Build interacts with Google Compute Engine (GCE) to provision compute resources. Due to organic traffic growth, Cloud Build exceeded its GCE quota, triggering a retry-storm instead of graceful degradation. This prevented the creation of new worker instances, leading to a regional outage as existing builds could not be processed.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Cloud Build: During the incident, builds were queued for execution but not actually executed and would have appeared as stuck. That applied both to builds created manually and via triggers. Upon this incident’s resolution, most of the builds would have exceeded the amount of time the build can be queued and were marked as expired. These builds will not be executed any more and must be re-created.\n* Google Cloud Deploy: New releases and rollouts (whether initiated manually or through automation) could be created, but the resources became stuck in an 'in-progress' state.

This failure degraded the building’s cooling infrastructure, leading to a partial shutdown of the europe-west-c zone to avoid thermal damage and causing Virtual Machines (VMs) to go offline. The event duration was 7 hours and 39 minutes and impacted various Google Cloud services in the affected zone.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and resilience.\n##\n## **Root Cause**\nOn 23 October 2024, at 18:22 US/Pacific time, an electrical arc flash occurred in one of the europe-west3-c zone's power distribution units, resulting in a partial power outage. This incident also affected the cooling infrastructure, leading to a rise in ambient temperature. To prevent damage, some IT equipment at the facility was shut down, causing Virtual Machines (VMs) in the datacenter to go offline and impacting multiple cloud services in the zone.\n##\n## **Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to VM failures in europe-west3-c zone at 18:39 US/Pacific on 23 October 2024, and immediately launched an investigation. Upon understanding the issue's nature and scope, engineers took precautionary measures to ensure equipment safety by shutting it down and diverting traffic away from the affected infrastructure at 20:43 US/Pacific. Power was manually restored at 21:44 US/Pacific by transferring the load away from the failed components. Cloud traffic was gradually reintroduced to the datacenter at 00:30 US/Pacific on 24 October, 2024\\. Full restoration of all cloud services in the affected zone was completed by 2:09 US/Pacific.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future. To ensure continued high availability in the future, Google are pursuing the following actions:\n* Complete root cause investigation on the arc flash and complete repairs of the affected power distribution unit.\n* Ensure that the underlying root cause(s) of the arc flash are not present in any other data centers, and remediating any risks which are discovered in the analysis of the event.\n* Further hardening GCP’s Persistent Disk services to prevent any regional impact during single-zone issues. This work is anticipated to be fully rolled out in the coming weeks.\n## **Detailed Description of Impact**\n**Google Compute Engine (GCE) and Persistent Disk (PD):**\nCustomers experienced increased latency and errors when creating new GCE instances and attaching Persistent Disk volumes to existing instances in all europe-west3 zones from 23 October 2024 19:12 to 23:34 US/Pacific. The elevated error rates resulted from problems in access control services for multiple zones that were caused by a misconfiguration and triggered by the outage in europe-west3-c. To prevent a recurrence of this issue, engineers have hardened this component against zonal outages in europe-west3.\nAdditionally, a small percentage of Persistent Disk volumes in europe-west3-c were unavailable from 23 October 2024 18:24 to 24 October 2024 00:58 US/Pacific.\n**Google Cloud Pub/Sub:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls from 23 October 2024 18:25 to 18:41 US/Pacific and elevated latency for push subscriptions from 23 October 2024 22:57 to 24 October 2024 00:11 US/Pacific in europe-west3-c.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced higher latencies for both batch and streaming jobs from 23 October 2024 19:05 to 23:55 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Dataproc:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in all API calls from 23 October 2024 19:12 to 22:00 US/Pacific in europe-west3 and a few customers might have experienced errors in all API calls except the create cluster API call through 24 October 2024 23:47 US/Pacific.\n**Cloud Build:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls from 23 October 2024 20:52 to 24 October 2024 01:11 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):**\nDuring the period of the outage, a small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls to europe-west3. A small percentage of customers may have additionally experienced unavailability of their Kubernetes Control Planes in europe-west3 or europe-west3-c and/or Kubernetes nodes in europe-west3-c.\n**Vertex AI Batch Prediction:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in batch prediction jobs from 23 October 2024 19:45 to 23:30 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Cloud SQL:**\nCustomers creating or updating instances in europe-west3 may have experienced errors from 23 October 2024 18:35 US/Pacific to 24 October 2024 23:28 US/Pacific. Users with self-service or scheduled maintenance on instances in europe-west3 during this period may have experienced a failed update causing downtime.\n----------",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 23 October 2024 18:30\n**Incident End:** 24 October 2024 02:09\n**Duration:** 7 hours, 39 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n* Persistent Disk (PD)\n* Google Compute Engine\n* Google Cloud Pub/Sub\n* Google Cloud Dataflow\n* Dataproc\n* Cloud Build\n* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\n* Vertex AI Batch Prediction\n**Regions/Zones:** Region europe-west3 / Zone europe-west3-c\n**Description:**\nMultiple Google Cloud products were impacted in the europe-west3-c zone for a duration of 7 hours, 39 minutes. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to a power failure and cooling issue leading to a fraction of a zone being powered down causing services to be degraded.\nGoogle engineers implemented a fix to return the datacenter to full operation and this mitigated the issue.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Persistent Disk (PD): Customers may observe stuck VM creation, PD control plane errors.\n* Google Compute Engine: Customers lost access to several VMs and disks in the europe-west5-c zone. For the other two zones in the same region, less than 1% of the operations that touch instance and disk resources experienced internal errors.\n* Google Cloud Pub/Sub: Customers may have experienced higher latency for push subscriptions as well as a brief period of elevated Publish unavailability.\n* Google Cloud Dataflow: Batch jobs: some existing jobs experienced delays when scaling workers. Streaming jobs: jobs may not have progressed or scaled up workers.\n* Dataproc: Dataproc cluster operations failures. Uptick in cluster creation and deletion errors during the initial stages of the incident but mitigated from dataproc side by blocking the europe-west-3-c zone ASAP.\n* Cloud Build: Builds in Custom Worker pools took a long time to start.\n* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): Customers were unable to create new Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster nodes in the europe-west3-c zone.\n* Vertex AI Batch Prediction : Vertex batch prediction job failed with \"Unable to prepare an infrastructure for serving within time\" error.",

      "text": "## **Incident Report**\n## **Summary**\nOn Wednesday, 23 October 2024, a power failure occurred in a single data center within the europe-west3 region. This failure degraded the building’s cooling infrastructure, leading to a partial shutdown of the europe-west-c zone to avoid thermal damage and causing Virtual Machines (VMs) to go offline. The event duration was 7 hours and 39 minutes and impacted various Google Cloud services in the affected zone.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and resilience.\n##\n## **Root Cause**\nOn 23 October 2024, at 18:22 US/Pacific time, an electrical arc flash occurred in one of the europe-west3-c zone's power distribution units, resulting in a partial power outage. This incident also affected the cooling infrastructure, leading to a rise in ambient temperature. To prevent damage, some IT equipment at the facility was shut down, causing Virtual Machines (VMs) in the datacenter to go offline and impacting multiple cloud services in the zone.\n##\n## **Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to VM failures in europe-west3-c zone at 18:39 US/Pacific on 23 October 2024, and immediately launched an investigation. Upon understanding the issue's nature and scope, engineers took precautionary measures to ensure equipment safety by shutting it down and diverting traffic away from the affected infrastructure at 20:43 US/Pacific. Power was manually restored at 21:44 US/Pacific by transferring the load away from the failed components. Cloud traffic was gradually reintroduced to the datacenter at 00:30 US/Pacific on 24 October, 2024\\. Full restoration of all cloud services in the affected zone was completed by 2:09 US/Pacific.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future. To ensure continued high availability in the future, Google are pursuing the following actions:\n* Complete root cause investigation on the arc flash and complete repairs of the affected power distribution unit.\n* Ensure that the underlying root cause(s) of the arc flash are not present in any other data centers, and remediating any risks which are discovered in the analysis of the event.\n* Further hardening GCP’s Persistent Disk services to prevent any regional impact during single-zone issues. This work is anticipated to be fully rolled out in the coming weeks.\n## **Detailed Description of Impact**\n**Google Compute Engine (GCE) and Persistent Disk (PD):**\nCustomers experienced increased latency and errors when creating new GCE instances and attaching Persistent Disk volumes to existing instances in all europe-west3 zones from 23 October 2024 19:12 to 23:34 US/Pacific. The elevated error rates resulted from problems in access control services for multiple zones that were caused by a misconfiguration and triggered by the outage in europe-west3-c. To prevent a recurrence of this issue, engineers have hardened this component against zonal outages in europe-west3.\nAdditionally, a small percentage of Persistent Disk volumes in europe-west3-c were unavailable from 23 October 2024 18:24 to 24 October 2024 00:58 US/Pacific.\n**Google Cloud Pub/Sub:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls from 23 October 2024 18:25 to 18:41 US/Pacific and elevated latency for push subscriptions from 23 October 2024 22:57 to 24 October 2024 00:11 US/Pacific in europe-west3-c.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced higher latencies for both batch and streaming jobs from 23 October 2024 19:05 to 23:55 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Dataproc:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in all API calls from 23 October 2024 19:12 to 22:00 US/Pacific in europe-west3 and a few customers might have experienced errors in all API calls except the create cluster API call through 24 October 2024 23:47 US/Pacific.\n**Cloud Build:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls from 23 October 2024 20:52 to 24 October 2024 01:11 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):**\nDuring the period of the outage, a small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in API calls to europe-west3. A small percentage of customers may have additionally experienced unavailability of their Kubernetes Control Planes in europe-west3 or europe-west3-c and/or Kubernetes nodes in europe-west3-c.\n**Vertex AI Batch Prediction:**\nA small percentage of customers may have experienced errors in batch prediction jobs from 23 October 2024 19:45 to 23:30 US/Pacific in europe-west3.\n**Cloud SQL:**\nCustomers creating or updating instances in europe-west3 may have experienced errors from 23 October 2024 18:35 US/Pacific to 24 October 2024 23:28 US/Pacific. Users with self-service or scheduled maintenance on instances in europe-west3 during this period may have experienced a failed update causing downtime.\n----------",

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nA mismatch in configuration between two components of Google’s internal cluster management system resulted in a failure of the cluster service discovery component. This failure was triggered by a software rollout within the cluster management system that was believed to be non-impactful to operating jobs. The service discovery component is a fundamental dependency of the cluster management system, and its failure resulted in failures of other infrastructure services hosted in the cluster. Those failures resulted in downstream impacts for various Google Cloud services which are dependent on the cluster management system.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nOnce the mechanism of the fault in the internal lookup and task addressing system was identified, remediation was performed by correcting a file path, allowing the system to restart successfully. The cluster management and other downstream systems recovered once this system was back in operation.\nThe rollout of the portion of the cluster management system that triggered the outage has been paused, and the specific trigger will be remediated before rollouts of that system resume. Additionally, an update to the lookup and task addressing system is being applied to prevent recurrence even if the problematic cluster management software is rolled out again.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 15 October, 2024 23:05 to 16 October, 2024 02:49 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud products became unavailable in the us-west2-a zone / us-west2 region for a duration of 3 hours, 44 minutes.\n### Artifact Registry\nAsynchronous API operations to create new repositories saw an increased failure rate.\n### Cloud Build\nIncreased errors in CreateBuild calls (up to 7% at peak), builds delayed for 2 hours, builds with shorter TTLs expired.\n### Google Cloud Deploy\nRender, predeploy, deploy, verify, and postdeploy operations in us-west2 were unable to complete.\n### Google Cloud Dataflow\nCustomers experienced latency (slowness) while running both batch and streaming jobs.\n### Google Cloud Bigtable\nSome resources in us-west2-a experienced an increase in CANCELED and UNAVAILABLE errors.\n### Google Cloud SQL\nSome instance creation and backup operations failed.\n### Cloud Interconnect\nCloud Interconnect attachments to us-west2 could not be created, updated, or deleted.\n### Virtual Private Cloud\nProgramming of new VMs from other regions was not reaching the impacted zone.

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 2 October 2024, Google Cloud and Google Workspace Support experienced intermittent issues with case creation for 2 hours, 5 minutes, between 14:18 US/Pacific to 16:23 US/Pacific. As a result, some users encountered unexpected errors and slight delays in case creation due to this system disruption. Additionally, the backup case creation process (through the UI) experienced elevated latency. To our Google Cloud and Google Workspace customers who experienced delay in case creation during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Support’s ticket persistence layer has a capacity management system in its control plane to ensure availability. Google services that integrate with the ticket persistence layer are expected to perform a controlled ramp of traffic and respond to backpressure signals. If an integration continues sending additional load after backpressure signals, the capacity management system applies a temporary throttle to the specific integration to ensure the health of the system.\nBeginning at 14:18 on Wednesday, 02 October 2024, an existing internal Google reporting service that integrates with the ticket persistence layer responded to an increase in data volume by rapidly ramping traffic. Due to a latent issue in the reporting service, it sent traffic in a way that bypassed normal backpressure signals. Over time traffic from the reporting service reached an elevated level to cause high query latency for some operations in our support UI. Once load on the persistence layer exceeded pre-set limits, the capacity management system restored service by temporarily throttling the reporting service’s traffic. Due to a latent issue in the reporting service, when the temporary throttle expired the reporting service again rapidly ramped traffic until the capacity management system again applied a temporary throttle.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nAs each impact period was short, internal monitoring metrics for the support UI did not reach alarm thresholds until 15:01. Once these thresholds were met, Google engineers were alerted to the incident at 15:01 and immediately started working on the issue.\nAfter thorough analysis, our engineering team identified the source of the traffic to the ticket persistence layer and applied a long-lived throttle, restoring service.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* We are revising our monitoring to detect customer impact earlier.\n* We are revising the method used to integrate with the ticket persistence layer to perform a controlled ramp of traffic as well as improve detection and response to backpressure signals. This will ensure all integrations manage resources better, reducing dependency on capacity management failsafes.\n* We are updating our ticket persistence layer to apply traffic isolation and load shedding best practices so that traffic for customer support cases cannot be affected by traffic from internal reporting systems.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nBetween 14:18 US/Pacific to 16:23 US/Pacific on Wednesday 02, October 2024, users experienced intermittent delays in case creation (up to a minute). <5% of users who attempted to create a support case saw an error message “Unable to create case. Try again.” Almost all users who re-attempted creation succeeded. A small number of users experienced three consecutive failures and were presented with an alternate support contact form.\nAll customers were able to receive support during this time for existing cases.",

During the period of impact, the case creation UI directed customers experiencing the longest delays to create their case using a backup system. We have not received any reports of customers being unable to contact Support during the impacted period.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was the scaling behavior of a routine data pipeline. The data pipeline ramped use of a common persistence layer in a manner that bypassed normal load shedding and isolation. When the persistence layer became unhealthy, the control plane applied a temporary throttle to the data pipeline, enabling the Support UI to successfully create user cases, until the temporary throttle expired, at which time the pipeline repeated its behavior.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Users faced intermittent delays when attempting to create cases, with a few seeing errors.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 2 October 2024, Google Cloud and Google Workspace Support experienced intermittent issues with case creation for 2 hours, 5 minutes, between 14:18 US/Pacific to 16:23 US/Pacific. As a result, some users encountered unexpected errors and slight delays in case creation due to this system disruption. Additionally, the backup case creation process (through the UI) experienced elevated latency. To our Google Cloud and Google Workspace customers who experienced delay in case creation during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Support’s ticket persistence layer has a capacity management system in its control plane to ensure availability. Google services that integrate with the ticket persistence layer are expected to perform a controlled ramp of traffic and respond to backpressure signals. If an integration continues sending additional load after backpressure signals, the capacity management system applies a temporary throttle to the specific integration to ensure the health of the system.\nBeginning at 14:18 on Wednesday, 02 October 2024, an existing internal Google reporting service that integrates with the ticket persistence layer responded to an increase in data volume by rapidly ramping traffic. Due to a latent issue in the reporting service, it sent traffic in a way that bypassed normal backpressure signals. Over time traffic from the reporting service reached an elevated level to cause high query latency for some operations in our support UI. Once load on the persistence layer exceeded pre-set limits, the capacity management system restored service by temporarily throttling the reporting service’s traffic. Due to a latent issue in the reporting service, when the temporary throttle expired the reporting service again rapidly ramped traffic until the capacity management system again applied a temporary throttle.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nAs each impact period was short, internal monitoring metrics for the support UI did not reach alarm thresholds until 15:01. Once these thresholds were met, Google engineers were alerted to the incident at 15:01 and immediately started working on the issue.\nAfter thorough analysis, our engineering team identified the source of the traffic to the ticket persistence layer and applied a long-lived throttle, restoring service.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* We are revising our monitoring to detect customer impact earlier.\n* We are revising the method used to integrate with the ticket persistence layer to perform a controlled ramp of traffic as well as improve detection and response to backpressure signals. This will ensure all integrations manage resources better, reducing dependency on capacity management failsafes.\n* We are updating our ticket persistence layer to apply traffic isolation and load shedding best practices so that traffic for customer support cases cannot be affected by traffic from internal reporting systems.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nBetween 14:18 US/Pacific to 16:23 US/Pacific on Wednesday 02, October 2024, users experienced intermittent delays in case creation (up to a minute). <5% of users who attempted to create a support case saw an error message “Unable to create case. Try again.” Almost all users who re-attempted creation succeeded. A small number of users experienced three consecutive failures and were presented with an alternate support contact form.\nAll customers were able to receive support during this time for existing cases.",

From 11:23 to 12:28 US/ Pacific (1 hour and 5 minutes), customers were unable to login and were redirected to a maintenance page containing a notice of the outage while engineers fixed the issue.\nTo our Mandiant Security Validation SaaS customers whose business was impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThis issue occurred due to an implementation issue in a backend database that limited a sequence column value. The value was incremented beyond that limit causing the database and system to encounter an error which prevented users from running Actions, Sequence and Evaluations.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via a support case on 25 September 2024 at 01:41 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers adjusted the column value limit that was causing the issue. This required taking Mandiant Security Validation SaaS briefly offline to perform the necessary changes needed to resolve the issue and prevent it from recurring in the future. During this time users were redirected to a maintenance page informing them of the outage. Once the system was brought back online, engineers verified the underlying issue was resolved and that no further issues were encountered.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing a :\n* Thorough review of the system settings to ensure no further limitations exist that would cause this or similar issues to occur.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n* From 1:27 to 11:22 US/ Pacific, customers were able to login and view the UI, but were unable to create and run content (Actions/Evaluations/Sequences).\n* From 11:23 to 12:28 US/ Pacific, customers were redirected to a maintenance page containing a notice of the outage.",

From 11:23 to 12:28 US/ Pacific (1 hour and 5 minutes), customers were unable to login and were redirected to a maintenance page containing a notice of the outage while engineers fixed the issue.\nTo our Mandiant Security Validation SaaS customers whose business was impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThis issue occurred due to an implementation issue in a backend database that limited a sequence column value. The value was incremented beyond that limit causing the database and system to encounter an error which prevented users from running Actions, Sequence and Evaluations.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via a support case on 25 September 2024 at 01:41 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers adjusted the column value limit that was causing the issue. This required taking Mandiant Security Validation SaaS briefly offline to perform the necessary changes needed to resolve the issue and prevent it from recurring in the future. During this time users were redirected to a maintenance page informing them of the outage. Once the system was brought back online, engineers verified the underlying issue was resolved and that no further issues were encountered.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing a :\n* Thorough review of the system settings to ensure no further limitations exist that would cause this or similar issues to occur.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n* From 1:27 to 11:22 US/ Pacific, customers were able to login and view the UI, but were unable to create and run content (Actions/Evaluations/Sequences).\n* From 11:23 to 12:28 US/ Pacific, customers were redirected to a maintenance page containing a notice of the outage.",

In some regions, customers experienced a complete service outage for a period between 5 minutes and 67 minutes. Issue began on 18 September 2024 at 12:34 US/Pacific and was completely resolved on 18 September 2024 at 15:30 US/Pacific.\nTo our customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was a newly implemented automation code which created a bad traffic routing policy. This policy incorrectly directed our traffic routing control plane to mark all clusters as being unavailable to serve traffic for App Engine, Google Cloud Run functions (1st gen)* and dependent services. Google engineers intervened before the policy was rolled out to all clusters, resulting in a partial outage of the service.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via internal production monitoring on 18 September 2024 at 13:01 US/Pacific shortly after customers began experiencing the impact. Engineering teams have identified the automation which caused the impact and terminated it at 13:46. However customer impact was only mitigated at 15:30 post manually directing the traffic back to the affected clusters.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of the issue in the future and is completing the following actions: - We have removed the automation which caused the outage as a short term measure - We are working to implement a more efficient and well tested traffic routing maintenance process - We will implement safeguards in the automation pipeline to prevent recurrence of this issue\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Wednesday 18 September, 2024 from 12:34 US/Pacific to 15:30 US/Pacific, Google App Engine, Google Cloud Run Functions (1st gen)* and Cloud Firestore experienced elevated error rates and increased latency. Customers reported 5xx errors with the message “Request was aborted after waiting too long to attempt to service your request.” and high latency. Customers also experienced high cold starts during this time.\nIn 13 regions, customers experienced a complete service outage for a period between 5 minutes and 67 minutes.\n1. asia-east2\n2. asia-northeast2\n3. asia-northeast3\n4. asia-south1\n5. asia-southeast1\n6. asia-southeast2\n7. europe-west2\n8. europe-west3\n9. europe-west6\n10. northamerica-northeast1\n11. southamerica-east1\n12. us-central2\n13. us-west1\nIn other 11 regions, customers might observe elevated error rates:\n1. asia-east1\n2. asia-northeast1\n3. australia-southeast1\n4. europe-central2\n5. europe-west1\n6. us-central1\n7. us-east1\n8. us-east4\n9. us-west2\n10. us-west3\n11. us-west4\n*Cloud Run and Cloud Run functions (gen2) were not affected.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a potential physical link issue between the [Hyderabad, India edge location](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations) and Google's production backbone network.\nThe issue was mitigated by redirecting the network traffic away from the problematic link. Our engineers will continue to work with corresponding vendors to fix the underlying physical link issue.\n**Customer Impact:**\nGoogle Cloud Interconnect customers connecting to cloud regions asia-south1, asia-south2, and asia-southeast1 from [Hyderabad, India edge location](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations) experienced elevated packet loss.",

The list of impacted products and services is detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nMost Google Cloud products and services use a regional metadata store to support their internal operations. The metadata store supports critical functions such as servicing customer requests, load balancing, admin operations, and retrieving/storing metadata including server location information.\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) internal DNS depends on the regional metadata store for storing instance metadata. A routine update of the metadata store to a new software version had a change which resulted in poor handling of a rare resource contention corner case, which caused the writes from GCE internal DNS to a zonal replica of the metadata store to fail.\nDuring such zonal issues, we have automated failover mechanisms to use the healthy replicas from other zones. But during this disruption, a secondary issue caused automated failover to not work, rendering the entire metadata storage unavailable despite two other healthy zones being available.\nThis resulted in disruptions to all GCE instance operations in the asia-northeast1 region. Actions such as creating, deleting, starting, and stopping instances or consuming reservations were affected. This, in turn, affected operations of other services dependent on GCE instances, including GKE, Cloud Build, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Deploy and Cloud SQL.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by internal monitoring on 7 September 2024 at 04:26 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. The issue was fully mitigated at 06:10 US/Pacific after failover of the metadata storage operations to the healthy zones was manually initiated by our engineering team.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Improve the automated failover logic used in the metadata storage infrastructure.\n* Improve the testing of how the metadata storage service handles resource contention corner cases.\n* Improve internal processes and documentations to enable faster response and mitigation time for this type of issue.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n- **Google Compute Engine**\nGoogle Compute Engine requests and operations like creating, deleting, starting or modifying VMs were not executed.\n- **Cloud Build**\nCloud Build deployments via the Cloud Build API or via Cloud Build Integrations were not being executed.\n- **Cloud Dataflow**\nGoogle Cloud Dataflow jobs failed at start up, existing job autoscale functionality was disrupted.\n- **Cloud Deploy**\nGoogle Cloud Deploy actions (render, deploy, verify, pre- and post-deploy hooks) were unresponsive and unable to complete their tasks.\n- **Google Cloud SQL**\nGoogle Cloud SQL, dependent on Google Compute Engine, experienced operational issues during this incident. No database creation or deletion operations were possible during the incident.\n- **Google Kubernetes Engine**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine experienced issues with operations that depend on GCE. Specifically, cluster and node pool creation, node autoscaling, cluster and node upgrades, and automatic repairs were unsuccessful in the affected region and zones.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 7 September 2024 starting at 04:20 US/Pacific, several Google Cloud products experienced a service degradation of varying impact or were unavailable in asia-northeast1 region for a period of 1 hour 50 minutes. The list of impacted products and services is detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nMost Google Cloud products and services use a regional metadata store to support their internal operations. The metadata store supports critical functions such as servicing customer requests, load balancing, admin operations, and retrieving/storing metadata including server location information.\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE) internal DNS depends on the regional metadata store for storing instance metadata. A routine update of the metadata store to a new software version had a change which resulted in poor handling of a rare resource contention corner case, which caused the writes from GCE internal DNS to a zonal replica of the metadata store to fail.\nDuring such zonal issues, we have automated failover mechanisms to use the healthy replicas from other zones. But during this disruption, a secondary issue caused automated failover to not work, rendering the entire metadata storage unavailable despite two other healthy zones being available.\nThis resulted in disruptions to all GCE instance operations in the asia-northeast1 region. Actions such as creating, deleting, starting, and stopping instances or consuming reservations were affected. This, in turn, affected operations of other services dependent on GCE instances, including GKE, Cloud Build, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Deploy and Cloud SQL.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by internal monitoring on 7 September 2024 at 04:26 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. The issue was fully mitigated at 06:10 US/Pacific after failover of the metadata storage operations to the healthy zones was manually initiated by our engineering team.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Improve the automated failover logic used in the metadata storage infrastructure.\n* Improve the testing of how the metadata storage service handles resource contention corner cases.\n* Improve internal processes and documentations to enable faster response and mitigation time for this type of issue.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n- **Google Compute Engine**\nGoogle Compute Engine requests and operations like creating, deleting, starting or modifying VMs were not executed.\n- **Cloud Build**\nCloud Build deployments via the Cloud Build API or via Cloud Build Integrations were not being executed.\n- **Cloud Dataflow**\nGoogle Cloud Dataflow jobs failed at start up, existing job autoscale functionality was disrupted.\n- **Cloud Deploy**\nGoogle Cloud Deploy actions (render, deploy, verify, pre- and post-deploy hooks) were unresponsive and unable to complete their tasks.\n- **Google Cloud SQL**\nGoogle Cloud SQL, dependent on Google Compute Engine, experienced operational issues during this incident. No database creation or deletion operations were possible during the incident.\n- **Google Kubernetes Engine**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine experienced issues with operations that depend on GCE. Specifically, cluster and node pool creation, node autoscaling, cluster and node upgrades, and automatic repairs were unsuccessful in the affected region and zones.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support (All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 4 September, 2024 08:16\n**Incident End:** 4 September, 2024 12:25\n**Duration:** 4 hours, 9 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nCloud Run, Google App Engine, Google Cloud Composer, Google Cloud Console, Google Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Marketplace, Cloud Deployment Manager\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGlobally, multiple cloud products experienced deployment failures due to the inaccessibility of Cloud Deployment Manager (CDM) services. This resulted in outages affecting all deployments and the CDM user interface within the cloud console for a duration of 4 hours and 9 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a regressive change in our rollout strategy. This change inadvertently caused all incoming requests to be discarded, resulting in widespread RPC errors for both internal systems and external customers.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCloud Composer:\nAll Composer 1 operations (creations/updates/deletions) were failing globally.\nRunning Composer 1 environments were not affected.\nAll other versions (Composer 2, Composer 3) were not affected.\nCloud Marketplace:\nCustomers experienced errors when deploying Deployment Manager based solutions on Google Cloud Marketplace.\nCloud Deployment Manager services were unreachable, caused outages for all deployments and the Deployment Manager UI in the Cloud Console.\nApp Engine Flexible:\nApp Engine Flexible experienced failures in delete flows in us-central1.\n70-100% of all delete requests failed for ~90 min. spread across when the DM was unavailable.\nServing plane was not affected.\nServerless VPC Access:\nApp Engine Standard, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run were not able to create, update or delete VPC Access Connectors globally.\nExisting connectors were not affected.\nCloud Deployment Manager:\nAll Cloud Deployment Manager operations (create/update/deletes) were failing globally\nCustomers were unable to view, update or delete the deployments via the Google Cloud Console\nAll beta functionalities of Cloud Deployment Manager (Type Providers, Actions) were failing globally.",

During the time, ingress traffic to europe-west2 and egress traffic from europe-west2 experienced elevated latencies, connection timeouts, and connection failures.\n## Root Cause\nOn 12 August 2024 06:20 US/Pacific, primary and backup power feeds were both lost in a [Google Point of Presence (POP)](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations) due to a substation switchgear failure. The affected POP hosts about ⅓ of serving first-layer [Google Front Ends (GFEs)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/infrastructure/design#google-frontend-service) located in europe-west2 and some distributed networking equipment for that region. The power loss impacted the following Google products and services that depend on GFEs in that region:\n* Google Cloud APIs, Google Workspace, and other Google services like YouTube,\n* Customer-created global external application and proxy network load balancers, including Cloud CDN\nThe power loss also impacted the following Google Cloud products which depended on impacted networking equipment:\n* Customer-created regional external application, proxy network, and passthrough network load balancers in the europe-west2 region,\n* External protocol forwarding and VM external IP address connectivity for VMs in the europe-west2 region.\n* Google Cloud Interconnect connections in some LHR colocation facilities.\nImpact was limited to situations where either or both of the following was true:\n* Inbound requests or connections were routed into the europe-west2 region of Google’s network, from the Internet, and those requests or connections depended on networking equipment that was offline, or unreachable pending reconvergence.\n* Outbound responses were routed to the Internet, from the europe-west2 region of Google’s network, and those responses depended on networking equipment that was without power.\nThe power outage caused Internet routes advertised by Google to be withdrawn in networks connected to Google’s network. The withdrawn routes were automatically replaced by other Google-advertised routes that didn’t depend on impacted networking equipment. Withdrawing and replacing routes relies on the BGP protocol and its timers, so replacement route convergence is not instantaneous, and overloading in the automatically selected replacement route GFEs extended the duration of the incident.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n* Google Workspace: _Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Chat, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Meet and Google Tasks users connecting to Workspace services from the UK region and surrounding areas experienced connectivity issues as described in the next point.\n* GFE-based products and services: _Customers on the Internet experienced a spike of broken connections followed by elevated latencies or HTTP error responses when communicating with GFE-powered Google APIs and services or customer-created global external application and proxy network load balancers. At roughly 06:23 US/Pacific, Google automatically redirected connections to the nearest possible first-layer GFEs with some latency penalty. Unfortunately, some of the nearest possible first-layer GFEs were overloaded until 06:48 when Google engineers made adjustments to more efficiently distribute incoming requests among nearby first-layer GFEs. Depending on the Google API or service or the customer-created global external load balancer, elevated latencies could have persisted until about 08:30 US/Pacific. Elevated latencies also could have applied to customer-created global external load balancers that had Cloud CDN enabled.\n* Regional Google Cloud products and services: _Until replacement routes were in effect, customers on the Internet experienced connection failures to the following GCP resources in the europe-west2 region: * Regional external application, proxy network, and passthrough network load balancers. * External protocol forwarding and VM external IP addresses.\n* Google Cloud Interconnect: _Google Cloud Interconnect connections in some LHR colocation facilities (lhr-zone1-47, lhr-zone1-832, lhr-zone1-2262, lhr-zone1-4885, lhr-zone1-99051 and lhr-zone2-47) remained offline from 06:20 US/Pacific to at least 06:57 US/Pacific, when power was restored.\nAt 06:43 US/Pacific, power was restored to the impacted networking equipment. Google networking equipment was fully operational by 06:57 US/Pacific, and connectivity to GFE-based products and services, regional Google Cloud products and services, and Google Cloud Interconnect resumed shortly thereafter.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nMultiple Google engineering teams were alerted and automated recovery tooling was triggered as expected; however, manual adjustments were required to address subsequent first-layer GFE overload. Google is reviewing automation improvements in tasks that required manual intervention to reduce the duration of future power event impact. Similarly, Google is working to increase Cloud Interconnect control plane resilience and reduce mitigation time through automated reaction to isolation events.\nAdditionally Google's partner who maintains the affected facility power in LHR (London) is conducting a full root cause analysis with the switchboard manufacturer and substation owner(s) involved in supplying power, including follow up as to why stored or generated on-site emergency power did not carry loads.",

During this period, these operations were stuck in a pending state. To our PD customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Root Cause\nDue to a coordination error, an internal capacity reclamation process was triggered prematurely without having the necessary internal software in place. As a result, user-initiated disk deletes and related operations were blocked and remained in a pending state for an extended period. It affected approximately 85% of scopes.\nOnce the issue was resolved, the blocked operations were automatically unblocked and completed successfully.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via monitoring alert on July 26 at 9:57 US/Pacific and promptly began an investigation. Upon understanding the issue, engineers swiftly initiated a clean-up of blocked operations, to prevent the issue from affecting more disks.\nTo fully resolve the issue, engineers accelerated the deployment of the software update across remaining scopes. This allowed the stalled operations to complete gracefully, unblocking customer-initiated operations.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a recurrence of this issue and is taking the following actions:\n* **Enforce a rigorous review process:** All future internal cleanup operations will undergo a thorough review and validation process to identify and mitigate potential conflicts with other ongoing processes.\n* **Make error-handling more robust:** Improve the system's ability to detect and gracefully handle stuck operations, preventing them from blocking customer-initiated actions.\n* **Address tooling gaps for phased rollout:** All future internal internal capacity reclamation processes will be conducted in phases to minimize the impact if any unexpected issues arise.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Friday, July 26, 2024, from 9:57 to 18:11 US/Pacific, PD customers globally experienced issues with disk delete and update operations. This also affected other disk-related actions.\nSpecifically, impacted customers encountered extended delays or failures with the following operations:\n* Disk deletions\n* Virtual Machine (VM) deletions (due to pending disk deletions)\n* Managed Instance Group scale-down operations",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn July 26, 2024, Persistent Disk (PD) experienced issues with disk delete and instance delete operations for a duration of 8 hours and 14 minutes, potentially affecting customers globally. During this period, these operations were stuck in a pending state. To our PD customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Root Cause\nDue to a coordination error, an internal capacity reclamation process was triggered prematurely without having the necessary internal software in place. As a result, user-initiated disk deletes and related operations were blocked and remained in a pending state for an extended period. It affected approximately 85% of scopes.\nOnce the issue was resolved, the blocked operations were automatically unblocked and completed successfully.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via monitoring alert on July 26 at 9:57 US/Pacific and promptly began an investigation. Upon understanding the issue, engineers swiftly initiated a clean-up of blocked operations, to prevent the issue from affecting more disks.\nTo fully resolve the issue, engineers accelerated the deployment of the software update across remaining scopes. This allowed the stalled operations to complete gracefully, unblocking customer-initiated operations.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a recurrence of this issue and is taking the following actions:\n* **Enforce a rigorous review process:** All future internal cleanup operations will undergo a thorough review and validation process to identify and mitigate potential conflicts with other ongoing processes.\n* **Make error-handling more robust:** Improve the system's ability to detect and gracefully handle stuck operations, preventing them from blocking customer-initiated actions.\n* **Address tooling gaps for phased rollout:** All future internal internal capacity reclamation processes will be conducted in phases to minimize the impact if any unexpected issues arise.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Friday, July 26, 2024, from 9:57 to 18:11 US/Pacific, PD customers globally experienced issues with disk delete and update operations. This also affected other disk-related actions.\nSpecifically, impacted customers encountered extended delays or failures with the following operations:\n* Disk deletions\n* Virtual Machine (VM) deletions (due to pending disk deletions)\n* Managed Instance Group scale-down operations",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, 15 July 2024, Google Cloud Monitoring experienced elevated query errors and degraded performance in the us-central1 region for 2 hours and 6 minutes. This impacted monitoring metrics for cloud products in the region, including Cloud Spanner, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, AlloyDB and Cloud SQL.\nTo our Cloud Monitoring customers whose monitoring capabilities were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. We understand the critical role monitoring plays in maintaining your cloud environments, and this is not the level of service we strive to provide.\nWe are committed to preventing similar disruptions in the future and continuing to improve the platform's reliability and performance.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Monitoring has experienced a sudden and unexpected, inorganic increase in usage, observing a 30% increase in growth over the past 30 days. Our automation responded to the unexpected growth, which pushed services past their current scaling limits leading to out of memory crashes reducing/degrading Cloud Monitoring query capacity in the us-central1 region.\nAs a mitigation, engineers increased the memory allocation limit on affected services to increase their scaling limits and will be working with the source of the unexpected growth to try to reduce their usage back into more expected limits.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by internal monitoring on 15 July 2024 at 08:53 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nAt 10:11 US/Pacific engineers began rolling out mitigation to increase the memory allocation limit on affected services. The mitigation was completed at 10:52 US/Pacific resolving the issue.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Dynamically adjust our scaling limits to better respond to load demands using spare capacity\n* Partition the zonal query processor into multiple partitions to avoid becoming a bottleneck in times of heavy load.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday 15 July 2024, from 08:46 to 10:52 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced increased query latency and/or reduced availability in the us-central1.\n**Cloud Monitoring**\nCloud Monitoring customers experienced increased query latency and/or reduced availability for Cloud Monitoring metrics stored in the us-central1 cloud region. Queries for metrics stored in other regions, including the \"global\" region were unaffected.\n**Metrics**\nCloud Monitoring API queries e.g. via QueryTimeSeries, ListTimeSeries, or PromQL endpoints, for metrics in this region may have returned a partial or empty response. Queries fanning out to multiple regions would have returned applicable data from all other regions.\nCertain service metrics which are backed by precomputed queries in this region were unavailable during the outage window. Due to the real-time nature of precomputed queries, these gaps cannot be backfilled and will remain unavailable indefinitely.\n**Dashboards**\nCloud Console dashboards displaying metrics from this region may have data gaps and, in turn, presented a degraded experience to end users during the outage window. Dashboards displaying precomputed query-backed metrics will continue to display data gaps during this period.\n**Incidents and Alert Notifications**\nCloud Alerting policies where the location is retained and maps to the us-central1 region may have returned incorrect results which prevented alerts from firing and associated notifications being sent in a timely manner or, if short-lived, at all.\n80% of alerts in us-central1 (8% of all alerts) were dropped during the outage window, however most Cloud Alerting policies are global, not region-specific.\nCustomers may have experienced the following related to Cloud Alerting incidents and alert notifications:\n* Incident creation: Some incidents were never created, and related notifications were not sent out.\n* Incident creation: Some incidents were created up to 2 hours late; and the notifications were delayed by a similar duration.\n* Incident close: Some incidents opened prior to the outage were prematurely closed due to the absence of the alerting signal during the outage window.\n* Incident reopen: The incidents that prematurely closed as captured in #3 could reopen once the alerts started firing again - leading to double alerting for customers.\nWhen the query processing service was restored, all ad-hoc and precomputed queries, dashboards, alerts, and notifications also returned to normal operation with the exception of the data gaps noted for precomputed queries during the outage.\n**Cloud Bigtable**\nCloud Bigtable customers experienced a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics for bigtable.googleapis.com for the duration of this outage. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, Cloud Bigtable Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well. Cloud Bigtable's internal auto scaling capability was not impacted, but customers who use Google Cloud Monitoring metrics to scale their Cloud Bigtable usage would have lost metric signal and may have incorrectly scaled their instances as a result of this outage.\n**Alloy DB**\nAlloyDB customers experienced intermittently a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics from 9:00 to 10:30 PDT. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, AlloyDB Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well.There were no missing metrics after 10:30 PDT.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine customers experienced intermittently a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics from 9:00 to 10:30 PDT. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, GKE Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well.There were no missing metrics after 10:30 PDT.\nWorkload autoscaling based on external / custom metrics may not have been actuated during this period. Workload autoscaling based on cpu / memory were not affected.\n**Cloud Spanner**\nCloud Spanner customers experienced a period of missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics for spanner.googleapis.com for the duration of this outage. When Google Cloud Monitoring returned to normal operations, Cloud Spanner Google Cloud Monitoring returned as well. Cloud Spanner’s native autoscaler was not impacted, but customers who use Google Cloud Monitoring metrics to scale their Cloud Spanner usage (e.g. via open source autoscalers) would have lost metric signal and may have incorrectly scaled their instances as a result of this outage. Data Boost customers who have set up alerts for usage may have gotten alerted as well but Data Boost billing is not impacted.\n**Cloud SQL**\nCloud SQL customers experienced missing Google Cloud Monitoring metrics cloudsql.googleapis.com for the duration of this period. Some customers who set alerts based on these metrics may get incorrectly notified, but Cloud SQL operations and the database datapath were not affected by this incident. The databases all continued to operate normally.",

Some customers who set alerts based on these metrics may get incorrectly notified, but Cloud SQL operations and the database datapath were not affected by this incident. The databases all continued to operate normally.",

Despite Chronicle's fault-tolerant setup guaranteeing uninterrupted service availability, its performance gradually diminished over time as a result of diminished data processing capabilities.\nTo alleviate infrastructure load, Chronicle engineering implemented measures to delay the reprocessing of specific data. However, attempts to resume reprocessing led to further delays. Concurrently, a separate, unrelated bug caused excessive database writes, resulting in delays in data normalization. To address this issue, the data pipeline was disabled to eliminate significant delays in data normalization.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Delays in BigQuery Export and Multi event rules processing\n* Delays in late arriving enrichments and slower Unified Data Model (UDM) search.",

To our customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nBeginning 8 June 2024, a novel form of user request to the GenerateContent API triggered intermittent segmentation faults in the Vertex Serving Prediction API servers. An affected server would restart after the segfault, and load balancers would send user queries to other healthy API servers until the affected server returned to service. The user-visible outage began when the rate of segfault-triggering traffic increased and the number of API servers offline simultaneously was sufficient to affect overall serving capacity relative to load.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via internal production monitoring on 10 June 2024 at 07:35 US/Pacific. At this time there was no visible customer impact and google engineers identified the root cause of the segmentation fault and developed a fix which they started progressively rolling out. However, on 12 June 2024 at 12:06 US/Pacific, multiple services built on top of Vertex Prediction started to report user requests that were affected by this issue in production. The root cause of the issue was quickly verified to be the same issue discovered on 10 June 2024 and accelerated the in-progress rollout. The rollout completed on 12 June 2024 at 15:59 US/Pacific, fully mitigating the issue\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of the issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Ensuring early signals of server binary issues are captured in production healthiness analysis, and investigated timely.\n- Ensuring a release validation of feature changes and updates in production.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nBetween 12 June 2024 12:06 and 12 June 2024 15:59 some users in regions: us-central1, asia-southeast1, europe-west3, europe-west4, us-east1, us-west1, northamerica-northeast1, us-east4, may have experienced the following:\n**Vertex AI Online Prediction:**\n- Google Vertex AI experienced high latency and elevated 500, 502 error rates, while executing prediction tasks using Predict, RawPredict, GenerateContent, and StreamGenerateContent methods.\n- Customers may have also experienced failure in running prediction requests with “CANCELLED” errors.\n**Dialogflow CX:**\n- Dialogflow CX Generators, Generative Fallback, and ML entities experienced elevated “INTERNAL” and “DEADLINE_EXCEEDED” errors and in some cases timeouts.\n**Agent Assist:**\n- Agent Assist features including (Proactive) Generative Knowledge Assist experienced elevated error rates in LLM Summarization and topic modeling features, including Summarization baseline V2 and Summarization with custom sections (powered by generator).\n**Contact Center AI:**\n- Contact Center AI Insights features including LLM summarization and LLM topic modeling also experienced elevated error rates.",

To our customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nBeginning 8 June 2024, a novel form of user request to the GenerateContent API triggered intermittent segmentation faults in the Vertex Serving Prediction API servers. An affected server would restart after the segfault, and load balancers would send user queries to other healthy API servers until the affected server returned to service. The user-visible outage began when the rate of segfault-triggering traffic increased and the number of API servers offline simultaneously was sufficient to affect overall serving capacity relative to load.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via internal production monitoring on 10 June 2024 at 07:35 US/Pacific. At this time there was no visible customer impact and google engineers identified the root cause of the segmentation fault and developed a fix which they started progressively rolling out. However, on 12 June 2024 at 12:06 US/Pacific, multiple services built on top of Vertex Prediction started to report user requests that were affected by this issue in production. The root cause of the issue was quickly verified to be the same issue discovered on 10 June 2024 and accelerated the in-progress rollout. The rollout completed on 12 June 2024 at 15:59 US/Pacific, fully mitigating the issue\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of the issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Ensuring early signals of server binary issues are captured in production healthiness analysis, and investigated timely.\n- Ensuring a release validation of feature changes and updates in production.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nBetween 12 June 2024 12:06 and 12 June 2024 15:59 some users in regions: us-central1, asia-southeast1, europe-west3, europe-west4, us-east1, us-west1, northamerica-northeast1, us-east4, may have experienced the following:\n**Vertex AI Online Prediction:**\n- Google Vertex AI experienced high latency and elevated 500, 502 error rates, while executing prediction tasks using Predict, RawPredict, GenerateContent, and StreamGenerateContent methods.\n- Customers may have also experienced failure in running prediction requests with “CANCELLED” errors.\n**Dialogflow CX:**\n- Dialogflow CX Generators, Generative Fallback, and ML entities experienced elevated “INTERNAL” and “DEADLINE_EXCEEDED” errors and in some cases timeouts.\n**Agent Assist:**\n- Agent Assist features including (Proactive) Generative Knowledge Assist experienced elevated error rates in LLM Summarization and topic modeling features, including Summarization baseline V2 and Summarization with custom sections (powered by generator).\n**Contact Center AI:**\n- Contact Center AI Insights features including LLM summarization and LLM topic modeling also experienced elevated error rates.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nBetween Thursday, 30 May 2024 and Thursday, 13 June 2024 at 23:45 US/Pacific on, BigQuery customers experienced elevated query latencies across the multiregions:us and multiregions:eu. As a result, operations requiring compute resources (queries, loads, extracts) would have also experienced resource contention during the same period, and some customers with queries or operations relying on the BigQuery Autoscaler would have been unable to scale up to the desired limits.\nAdditionally, between 16:46 to 20:00 US/Pacific on Monday, 10 June 2024, BigQuery experienced elevated errors across multiple APIs (Jobs, Query, Load, Extract, Storage Read and Write APIs) in the multiregion:us region.\n## Root Cause\nBigQuery uses a distributed shuffle infrastructure for execution of large and complex joins, aggregations and analytic operations needed for query execution. Shuffle storage is a tiered architecture, optimizing for storing data in-memory, but uses SSD then HDD as backing stores to flush to as the aggregate needs increase. The incident was caused by a combination of factors.\n1. Colossus, Google's distributed file system [1] , was migrating to a newer version. This migration caused a gradual increase in traffic to the new system per zone across the fleet.\n2. The SSD cache configuration for flushing was not appropriately set up for the newer file system version.\n3. As a result, BigQuery gradually lost portions of its SSD cache in the relevant zones, proportional to the traffic migrated to the new system.\n4. Queries needing to flush to disk experienced increased latency as flushing directly to HDD increasingly dominated.\nDiverting the network traffic from an affected zone is a mitigation usually taken while determining the root cause of a problem. However, an operator error resulted in reduction of capacity in multiple zones simultaneously on Monday 10 June, 2024 at 16:46 US/Pacific. This led to elevated errors across BigQuery APIs until 20:00 PST the same day when the impact of excessive traffic redirection was mitigated.\n[1] : https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system\n## Remediation and Prevention\n* At 10:23 US/Pacific on Thursday, 30 May 2024, Google engineers were alerted to occasional increased latency of operations materializing data into storage in one zone in the US region. BigQuery automation redirected traffic out of the zone and investigation started to find the root cause.\n* By Wednesday, 5 June 2024, Google engineers expedited the investigation by coordinating between BigQuery engineering and several GCP infrastructure teams.\n* By Monday, 10 June 2024, other BigQuery zones alerted for similar symptoms, with automation being prevented from redirecting traffic as mitigation. Customer reports of slowness began accumulating.\n* **[Wider Impact Starts]** At 16:46 on Monday, 10 June, 2024, an excessive redirection of traffic erroneously occurred. At 18:07 US/Pacific, the incident escalated further with multiple infrastructure, BigQuery engineering, and incident and customer management teams involved.\n* At 18:28 the excessive traffic redirection was rectified. Google engineers then took several actions to quickly absorb the incoming traffic by adding front end capacity and shifting traffic between zones while internal caches recovered.\n* **[Wider Impact Fully Mitigated]** At 20:00 on Monday, 10 June, 2024, traffic returned to baseline before the major sub-incident. Elevated incident management to root cause the original symptoms of storage slowness continued.\n* Due to the nature of the root cause, zone traffic redirection which is the fastest and most reliable mitigation for users impacted by a zone slowness caused the problem to shift to other BigQuery customers elsewhere. This unfortunately complicated investigation and remediation for users during the investigation and extended the duration of impact until the true root cause and trigger were identified.\n* **[Incident Fully Mitigated]** At 21:00, on Thursday June 13, 2024, the fundamental root cause of the gradual loss of SSD caching, and its secondary and tertiary impact on shuffle flush performance and query latency was confirmed. Google engineers rectified the SSD cache configuration (the size of which was already increased in many zones as mitigation) and the incident was fully mitigated.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n* **Enhanced Detection :** - Enhance BigQuery’s telemetry to detect anomalies in SSD cache utilization faster and more efficiently.\n* Increase the SSD cache capacity for BigQuery Shuffle flushing across the fleet and rectify the SSD cache configuration to restore shuffle flushing performance to shorten mitigation time for any future occurrences.\n* **Preventive Action Items :** - Increase the safeguards against excessive traffic redirection by any means (manual and automatic). - Improve BigQuery’s resilience to sudden increases in traffic for the Streaming APIs to recover faster.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n**BigQuery:**\n* A subset of customers would have experienced 500 errors while executing calls to insertAll and storage write APIs in the US Multi-region. Additionally, some customers may have experienced system errors using the Jobs and Query API.\n* BigQuery customers would have also experienced periods of reduced query performance and longer latencies. As a side effect, resource contention within user reservations would have also increased.\n* Some BigQuery customers experienced periods of inability to scale up resources using the BigQuery Autoscaler consistently.\n**Cloud Logging:** Ingestion delays to analytics buckets with local global.

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nCloud Shell enables all Google Cloud users to access and manage their cloud resources directly from their web browser, using a command-line interface. This service eliminates the need for users to install the Google Cloud Software Development Kits (SDK) or other tools on their local machines. Cloud Shell is implemented as a container running on a Virtual Machine (VM) in multi-tenant Google-owned projects.\nTo improve scalability and availability, Cloud Shell runs multiple Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters per region, and runs in multiple regions. These clusters are updated weekly.\nOn 4 June 2024, some users attempting to connect to Cloud Shell may have encountered connectivity issues for a duration of 3 hours 46 minutes. We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption has caused.\n## Root Cause\nDuring a routine weekly update, the Cloud Shell engineering team deployed a script that had been tested and validated in the pre-production environment. However, when executed across production GKE clusters supporting Cloud Shell, the script unintentionally enabled GKE API-side validation for custom Kubernetes resources. This validation caused GKE to reject updates to these custom resources, ultimately leading to provisioning errors in Cloud Shell. Affected customers would have received the following error message: \"Cloud Shell is experiencing some issues provisioning a VM to you. Please try again in a few minutes.\"\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via an internal monitoring alert on 4 June 2024 at 10:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue were identified, engineers rapidly developed and deployed a code fix to all affected Cloud Shell GKE clusters. This fix ensured that Cloud Shell's custom resources were correctly validated, thus resolving the provisioning errors. By 14:29 on the same day, the issue was fully mitigated for all impacted users.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue by implementing stricter change control through more comprehensive policies and guidelines for manual patching to the Cloud Shell environment.\nWe apologize for the impact of this issue and are taking steps to address the scope and duration of this incident as well as the root cause itself. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting on 4 June 2024 at 10:29 US/ Pacific, some customers attempting to connect to Cloud Shell may have encountered connectivity issues for a duration of 3 hours 46 minutes. Customers affected by this issue may have received the following error on Cloud Shell: “Cloud Shell is experiencing some issues provisioning a VM to you. Please try again in a few minutes.”",

We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption has caused.\n## Root Cause\nDuring a routine weekly update, the Cloud Shell engineering team deployed a script that had been tested and validated in the pre-production environment. However, when executed across production GKE clusters supporting Cloud Shell, the script unintentionally enabled GKE API-side validation for custom Kubernetes resources. This validation caused GKE to reject updates to these custom resources, ultimately leading to provisioning errors in Cloud Shell. Affected customers would have received the following error message: \"Cloud Shell is experiencing some issues provisioning a VM to you. Please try again in a few minutes.\"\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via an internal monitoring alert on 4 June 2024 at 10:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue were identified, engineers rapidly developed and deployed a code fix to all affected Cloud Shell GKE clusters. This fix ensured that Cloud Shell's custom resources were correctly validated, thus resolving the provisioning errors. By 14:29 on the same day, the issue was fully mitigated for all impacted users.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue by implementing stricter change control through more comprehensive policies and guidelines for manual patching to the Cloud Shell environment.\nWe apologize for the impact of this issue and are taking steps to address the scope and duration of this incident as well as the root cause itself. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting on 4 June 2024 at 10:29 US/ Pacific, some customers attempting to connect to Cloud Shell may have encountered connectivity issues for a duration of 3 hours 46 minutes. Customers affected by this issue may have received the following error on Cloud Shell: “Cloud Shell is experiencing some issues provisioning a VM to you. Please try again in a few minutes.”",

These management operations that are blocked by the safe mode activation include certain components of the workflows corresponding to cluster creation and upgrade.\n**Customer Impact:**\nDuring the incident timeframe users in GDC connected regions were unable to\n- Execute cluster creation\n- Upgrade clusters\nThe incident only prevented the operations listed above from being executed, it did not affect existing clusters or normal cluster operations.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 16 May 2024, the Google Infrastructure team was executing a routine maintenance action to shut down an unused Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) controller in a single Google Cloud zone. Unfortunately, a bug in the automation caused the component to be shut down in all zones where it was still in use. This resulted in networking connectivity issues and/or service disruptions for multiple Google Cloud products. The majority of the impact lasted 2 hours and 48 minutes.\nSome products took longer to fully recover based on the failures they experienced as outlined below in the impact section. To our Google Cloud customers, whose services were impacted, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was a bug in maintenance automation intended to shut down an unused VPC Controller in a single zone. A parameter specifying the zone for maintenance operations was modified during a refactor of the automation software earlier in the year. This modification resulted in the target zone parameter being ignored and the shut down operation taking effect on VPC controllers in all cloud zones. The test environment caught this failure mode, but the error was misinterpreted as an expected failure in the test environment. As a result, the change made it to production.\nShutdowns are a routine operational practice that we perform to maintain our systems without customer impact. The automation has a safeguard in place to limit the scope of maintenance operations. This safeguard was inadvertently disabled during a migration to a new version of the automation framework, resulting in the shutdown operation taking effect on VPC controllers in all cloud zones.\nA separate instance of the VPC Controller is launched into every Google Cloud zone. The jobs running in a given zone are responsible for programming the hosts in that zone (such as GCE VM hosts) so that the Endpoints running on those machines are able to reach other Endpoints in their VPC networks, reach on-prem destinations via VPN / Interconnect, and reach the Internet.\nWithin each zone, the VPC Control Plane is sharded into different components, each of which is responsible for programming a subset of traffic paths. The intent behind this architecture is to isolate outages affecting control plane jobs, in order to limit the blast radius. Outages affecting control plane jobs within a given cluster are expected to only affect the local cluster, and, ideally, only a subset of traffic within the local cluster.\nThe VPC Network architecture follows a fail static design. If control plane jobs are not available, the data plane continues using the last programmed state until the control plane jobs provide an update. This design reduced the impact of this outage to network activity involving interaction with the control plane, detailed below.\nThe VPC controller shutdown affected a subset of Cloud VPC control plane jobs in all zones, impacting control plane operations such as creating new VMs, auto scaler operations, applying configuration changes to customer projects and accurately reflecting changes in VM health state. The data plane impact included packet loss during VM live migration and network congestion in some zones.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage through internal monitoring alerts at 15:41 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Maintenance operations were immediately paused to prevent a recurrence. In parallel, affected VPC Controllers were brought back to a serving state. Once the operations were completed, VPC controllers in most of the zones were operational by 17:30 US/Pacific.\nBy 18:09 US/Pacific, all VPC controllers were restored, and the backlog of applying changes to the dataplane cleared up by 18:40 US/Pacific, mitigating impact for most of the products. Some products took longer to mitigate as outlined below in the impact section.\nGoogle Cloud is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n1. Implement additional safety measures to validate maintenance operations have appropriately scoped zone information.\n2. Extend defense in depth by improving safety in underlying tools to reject maintenance operations without zones specified.\n3. Increase on-demand access control to limit the ability of maintenance operations to work across multiple zones in a single invocation.\n4. Ensure we have the required safety checks, appropriate testing and validation processes for maintenance operations including positive and negative test cases for the safety measures 1, 2 and 3 above to prevent regression.\nWe apologize for the impact of this issue and are taking steps to address the scope and duration of this incident as well as the root cause itself. We thank you for your business.\n**## Detailed Description of Impact**\n**AlloyDB for PostgreSQL:**\n- From 15:30 to 19:00 US/Pacific, new AlloyDB VM creation may have failed in the europe-west1, europe-west3, europe-north1, europe-north2, asia-east1 and asia-northeast1 regions. All of these regions encountered <0.5% creation failure while the asia-northeast1 region encountered around 1% instance creation failures.\n- There were about 10% auto failovers triggered in us-central1 and less than 1% auto-failovers triggered in other regions.\n**Apigee :**\n- From 15:22 to 18:10 US/Pacific, some Apigee customers may have experienced network latencies, timeouts, or 500 errors in their runtimes.\n**Apigee Edge Public Cloud:**\n- From 15:22 to 18:10 US/Pacific, some Apigee Edge customers using GCP infrastructure may have experienced network latencies, timeouts, or 500 errors in their runtimes.\n- Additionally, some customers encountered errors during proxy deployments, resulting in partial deployments.\n- The impact was mostly resolved automatically as the network recovered. However, some cases of partial proxy deployments required manual intervention and were recovered by 17 May 2024 01:00 US/Pacific.\n**Batch:**\n- From 15:50 to 18:00 US/Pacific, batch jobs experienced elevated “NO_VM_REPORT” failure rates globally.\n**Cloud Build:**\n- From 15:39 to 17:28 US/Pacific, build jobs were experiencing elevated scheduling latency or time outs globally.\n**Cloud Composer:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, environment creation and update operations were failing across all regions. - 80% of environment creation operations failed. - Several environments that started image upgrade operation during the disruption were irrecoverably broken.\n- ~2.5% of Airflow tasks in running environments have failed globally due to a direct impact on connectivity of Composer components or outage impact on services that tasks have operated on.\n**Cloud Data Fusion:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, new instance creation experienced failures globally.\n- Error rates for new instance creation remained elevated until 17:46 PDT.\n- Instance creation requests submitted during this period may have timed out (failed) or succeeded after a longer-than-usual delay.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n- From 15:40 to 18:00 US/Pacific, Filestore instance operations such as Creation, and Deletion were degraded or failing in most regions and zones.\n- Some existing instances were unable to report metrics or start operations during this period, and due to the degraded VPC performance, customer VMs may not have been able to access existing instances.\n**Cloud Firewall:**\n- From 15:20 to 18:40 US/Pacific, all new firewall rules and firewall updates were not propagated. This affected firewall modifications for all VM instances in all GCE Zones.\n**Cloud IDS:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, any calls to alter or create IDS Endpoints would have failed.\n- Packet Mirroring to existing Cloud IDS Endpoints continued working as intended.\n**Cloud Interconnect:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:09 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud Interconnect resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Most existing Interconnect attachments were unaffected, except that changes to learned BGP routes did not propagate during the outage.\n- A small number of attachments (1%) experienced dataplane packet loss triggered by maintenance operations (e.g. VM migration or attachment dataplane machine maintenance).\n**Cloud Load Balancing:**\n- From 16:00 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make changes to load balancer configurations that involved network programming as a dependency.\n- Some customers experienced data plane impact as well, manifested as 500 errors; this was either because certain workloads could not be autoscaled due to absence of network programming or programming for their network was not complete before the service disruption started.\n**Cloud NAT:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud NAT resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Cloud NAT Dynamic Port Allocation (DPA) experienced allocation failures.\n- Most existing NAT configurations were unaffected, although a small number (<1%) saw dataplane loss. In addition, a small number (<1%) of NAT configurations took up to two additional hours for control plane changes to take effect.\n**Cloud NGFW Enterprise.**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, any calls to alter or create firewall-endpoints, firewall-endpoint-associations, security-profiles, or security-profile-groups would have failed.\n- Packet Inspection through “Proceed to L7 Inspection” Firewall Rules continued to work as intended.\n**Cloud Router:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud Router resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Changes to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes or any new learned routes advertised by customers, or any changes to route health triggered by unhealthy Interconnects / VPN tunnels, would not have been applied to the dataplane. Most existing BGP sessions stayed up during this event.\n**Cloud Run:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers using Direct VPC Egress for Cloud Run were unable to deploy new services. Customers with existing services using Direct VPC Egress were unable to scale up, including from 0.\n- Customers using existing VPC Access Connectors may have experienced network slowdown due to VPC Access Connectors not being able to scale up. Customers were also unable to deploy new VPC Access Connectors.\n**Cloud Security Command Center:**\n- From 16:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, 25% of scheduled Attack Path Simulations failed globally, affecting 7% of onboarded organizations.\n- The attack exposure scores of findings were not updated and new attack paths were not created during this time for affected customers.\n- Customers could still view older attack exposure scores and attack paths during this time.\n**Cloud Shell:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Cloud Shell sessions failed to start globally. ~15% of Cloud Shell sessions failed to startup.\n**Cloud VPN:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud VPN resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Most existing tunnels were not affected, except that changes to learned BGP routes did not propagate during the outage.\n- Routine VPN maintenance operations which occurred during this time window broke the dataplane for a small number (1%) of customer tunnels, which should have recovered along with the control plane.\n**Cloud Workstations:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Workstation startup failed primarily across US regions. Around 25% of Workstations failed to startup.\n**Colab Enterprise:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Colab Enterprise NotebookRuntime operations: AssignNotebookRuntime, StartNotebookRuntime, UpgradeNotebookRuntime failed globally.\n**Firebase Test Lab:**\n- Between 15:50 and 17:50 PDT, new Cloud VM creations failed globally.\n- Around 17% of the total VM creation requests globally at the time encountered issues.\n100% of customer executions failed on x86 emulators, impacting external customer CI tests, causing a complete pause of executions on those devices.\n**Google App Engine Flexible:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers were unable to create App Engine Flex deployments and App Engine Flex deployments were unable to scale up.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\n- From 15:44 to 18:52 US/Pacific, Batch and streaming jobs became unhealthy in all regions: - New Dataflow jobs were not initialized successfully. - Already running Dataflow batch jobs experienced prolonged execution time - Already running Streaming jobs experienced elevated watermarks\n**Google Cloud Dataproc:**\n- From 15:34 to 18:16 US/Pacific, cluster creations failed globally.\n- Some cluster deletion workflows may have failed causing the corresponding VMs to not be entirely deleted. Our engineers have identified such VMs and performed a clean up after the service disruption was mitigated.\n**Google Cloud Deploy:**\n- From 15:39 to 17:28 US/Pacific, Cloud Deploy customers were experiencing significant latency or time outs for renders and deploys globally.\n**Google Cloud Functions:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers using Cloud Functions were unable to deploy globally.\n- Customers using existing VPC Access Connectors may have experienced network slowdown due to VPC Access Connectors not being able to scale up. Customers were also unable to deploy new VPC Access Connectors.\n**Google Cloud SQL:**\n- From 15:47 to 16:30 US/Pacific, all create, clone, restore operations were failing along with some patch & update operations. Some instances were impacted due to operational failures.\n- From 16:30 to 19:00 US/Pacific, recovery was started with 90% of the impacted instances restored or - recovered by 19:00. Failure rates were still elevated at about 10%.\n- All remaining instances were restored by 22:30 US/Pacific.\n**Google Compute Engine:**\n- From 15:45 to 16:45 US/Pacific, most of the networking requests experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n- From 16:00 to 17:15 US/Pacific, instance deletion and instance update operations experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n- From 15:45 to 18:15 US/Pacific, for instance group creation and deletion operations experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine:**\n- From 15:45 to 17:30 US/Pacific, GKE operations that created or updated a VM failed. These operations are cluster creation and deletion, node pool creation and deletion, node upgrade, scaling up existing nodepool, network configuration changes.\n**Infrastructure Manager:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:15 US/Pacific, deployment create/update/delete/unlock and preview create/delete operations degraded globally with increased latency and failures.\nCustomers could still view and export deployments, previews, revisions and resources.\n**Looker:**\n- From 15:50 to 17:30 US/Pacific, <0.2% of looker instances went down due to Cloud SQL DB connection failure.\n**Memorystore for Memcached:**\n- From 15:45 to 17:15 US/Pacific, Create, Update and Delete Memcache instance operations were failing across all regions.\n- Around 0.8% of existing nodes restarted with a downtime of approximately 50 minutes possibly because these VMs underwent live migration.\n**Memorystore for Redis:**\n- From 15:40 to 18:40 US/Pacific, newly started Redis instance VM nodes were unreachable for networking. These instances could have been newly created by the customer, created indirectly through a mutating change such as resource scaling or addition of a new replica, or created automatically due to routine system operations. Impacts would have manifested as Basic (unreplicated) instances being unusable, and on Standard instances it could have appeared as reduced reader capacity or outright instance unavailability. Some Redis instances experienced some long tail issues and eventually recovered at 20:05 US/Pacific.\n- In addition, mutating operations such as CreateInstance failed during this window.\n**Vertex AI Workbench:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, customers could not provision new instances. Existing instances were not affected.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\n- From 15:20 to 18:40 US/Pacific, all new endpoints (e.g., VMs, VPN gateways) and services (load balancers) received no network programming and observed packet loss to a majority of destinations.\n- 0.07% of VMs that were migrated during the outage also experienced connectivity loss for the duration of the service disruption.\n- Long-running VMs were also affected due to data plane overload in a few locations. Peak loss was 3% in us-east1-c and average loss was 0.05% across all Cloud zones.\n- Access to Google Services was degraded in a few GCE zones; a fraction (up to 25% in us-east4-c) of TCP connections were blackholed. Applications that retry with a different TCP source port would have experienced limited outages even in these Cloud zones.\n--------------------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 16 May 2024, the Google Infrastructure team was executing a routine maintenance action to shut down an unused Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) controller in a single Google Cloud zone. Unfortunately, a bug in the automation caused the component to be shut down in all zones where it was still in use. This resulted in networking connectivity issues and/or service disruptions for multiple Google Cloud products. The majority of the impact lasted 2 hours and 48 minutes.\nSome products took longer to fully recover based on the failures they experienced as outlined below in the impact section. To our Google Cloud customers, whose services were impacted, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was a bug in maintenance automation intended to shut down an unused VPC Controller in a single zone. A parameter specifying the zone for maintenance operations was modified during a refactor of the automation software earlier in the year. This modification resulted in the target zone parameter being ignored and the shut down operation taking effect on VPC controllers in all cloud zones. The test environment caught this failure mode, but the error was misinterpreted as an expected failure in the test environment. As a result, the change made it to production.\nShutdowns are a routine operational practice that we perform to maintain our systems without customer impact. The automation has a safeguard in place to limit the scope of maintenance operations. This safeguard was inadvertently disabled during a migration to a new version of the automation framework, resulting in the shutdown operation taking effect on VPC controllers in all cloud zones.\nA separate instance of the VPC Controller is launched into every Google Cloud zone. The jobs running in a given zone are responsible for programming the hosts in that zone (such as GCE VM hosts) so that the Endpoints running on those machines are able to reach other Endpoints in their VPC networks, reach on-prem destinations via VPN / Interconnect, and reach the Internet.\nWithin each zone, the VPC Control Plane is sharded into different components, each of which is responsible for programming a subset of traffic paths. The intent behind this architecture is to isolate outages affecting control plane jobs, in order to limit the blast radius. Outages affecting control plane jobs within a given cluster are expected to only affect the local cluster, and, ideally, only a subset of traffic within the local cluster.\nThe VPC Network architecture follows a fail static design. If control plane jobs are not available, the data plane continues using the last programmed state until the control plane jobs provide an update. This design reduced the impact of this outage to network activity involving interaction with the control plane, detailed below.\nThe VPC controller shutdown affected a subset of Cloud VPC control plane jobs in all zones, impacting control plane operations such as creating new VMs, auto scaler operations, applying configuration changes to customer projects and accurately reflecting changes in VM health state. The data plane impact included packet loss during VM live migration and network congestion in some zones.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage through internal monitoring alerts at 15:41 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Maintenance operations were immediately paused to prevent a recurrence. In parallel, affected VPC Controllers were brought back to a serving state. Once the operations were completed, VPC controllers in most of the zones were operational by 17:30 US/Pacific.\nBy 18:09 US/Pacific, all VPC controllers were restored, and the backlog of applying changes to the dataplane cleared up by 18:40 US/Pacific, mitigating impact for most of the products. Some products took longer to mitigate as outlined below in the impact section.\nGoogle Cloud is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n1. Implement additional safety measures to validate maintenance operations have appropriately scoped zone information.\n2. Extend defense in depth by improving safety in underlying tools to reject maintenance operations without zones specified.\n3. Increase on-demand access control to limit the ability of maintenance operations to work across multiple zones in a single invocation.\n4. Ensure we have the required safety checks, appropriate testing and validation processes for maintenance operations including positive and negative test cases for the safety measures 1, 2 and 3 above to prevent regression.\nWe apologize for the impact of this issue and are taking steps to address the scope and duration of this incident as well as the root cause itself. We thank you for your business.\n**## Detailed Description of Impact**\n**AlloyDB for PostgreSQL:**\n- From 15:30 to 19:00 US/Pacific, new AlloyDB VM creation may have failed in the europe-west1, europe-west3, europe-north1, europe-north2, asia-east1 and asia-northeast1 regions. All of these regions encountered <0.5% creation failure while the asia-northeast1 region encountered around 1% instance creation failures.\n- There were about 10% auto failovers triggered in us-central1 and less than 1% auto-failovers triggered in other regions.\n**Apigee :**\n- From 15:22 to 18:10 US/Pacific, some Apigee customers may have experienced network latencies, timeouts, or 500 errors in their runtimes.\n**Apigee Edge Public Cloud:**\n- From 15:22 to 18:10 US/Pacific, some Apigee Edge customers using GCP infrastructure may have experienced network latencies, timeouts, or 500 errors in their runtimes.\n- Additionally, some customers encountered errors during proxy deployments, resulting in partial deployments.\n- The impact was mostly resolved automatically as the network recovered. However, some cases of partial proxy deployments required manual intervention and were recovered by 17 May 2024 01:00 US/Pacific.\n**Batch:**\n- From 15:50 to 18:00 US/Pacific, batch jobs experienced elevated “NO_VM_REPORT” failure rates globally.\n**Cloud Build:**\n- From 15:39 to 17:28 US/Pacific, build jobs were experiencing elevated scheduling latency or time outs globally.\n**Cloud Composer:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, environment creation and update operations were failing across all regions. - 80% of environment creation operations failed. - Several environments that started image upgrade operation during the disruption were irrecoverably broken.\n- ~2.5% of Airflow tasks in running environments have failed globally due to a direct impact on connectivity of Composer components or outage impact on services that tasks have operated on.\n**Cloud Data Fusion:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, new instance creation experienced failures globally.\n- Error rates for new instance creation remained elevated until 17:46 PDT.\n- Instance creation requests submitted during this period may have timed out (failed) or succeeded after a longer-than-usual delay.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n- From 15:40 to 18:00 US/Pacific, Filestore instance operations such as Creation, and Deletion were degraded or failing in most regions and zones.\n- Some existing instances were unable to report metrics or start operations during this period, and due to the degraded VPC performance, customer VMs may not have been able to access existing instances.\n**Cloud Firewall:**\n- From 15:20 to 18:40 US/Pacific, all new firewall rules and firewall updates were not propagated. This affected firewall modifications for all VM instances in all GCE Zones.\n**Cloud IDS:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, any calls to alter or create IDS Endpoints would have failed.\n- Packet Mirroring to existing Cloud IDS Endpoints continued working as intended.\n**Cloud Interconnect:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:09 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud Interconnect resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Most existing Interconnect attachments were unaffected, except that changes to learned BGP routes did not propagate during the outage.\n- A small number of attachments (1%) experienced dataplane packet loss triggered by maintenance operations (e.g. VM migration or attachment dataplane machine maintenance).\n**Cloud Load Balancing:**\n- From 16:00 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make changes to load balancer configurations that involved network programming as a dependency.\n- Some customers experienced data plane impact as well, manifested as 500 errors; this was either because certain workloads could not be autoscaled due to absence of network programming or programming for their network was not complete before the service disruption started.\n**Cloud NAT:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud NAT resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Cloud NAT Dynamic Port Allocation (DPA) experienced allocation failures.\n- Most existing NAT configurations were unaffected, although a small number (<1%) saw dataplane loss. In addition, a small number (<1%) of NAT configurations took up to two additional hours for control plane changes to take effect.\n**Cloud NGFW Enterprise.**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, any calls to alter or create firewall-endpoints, firewall-endpoint-associations, security-profiles, or security-profile-groups would have failed.\n- Packet Inspection through “Proceed to L7 Inspection” Firewall Rules continued to work as intended.\n**Cloud Router:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud Router resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Changes to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes or any new learned routes advertised by customers, or any changes to route health triggered by unhealthy Interconnects / VPN tunnels, would not have been applied to the dataplane. Most existing BGP sessions stayed up during this event.\n**Cloud Run:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers using Direct VPC Egress for Cloud Run were unable to deploy new services. Customers with existing services using Direct VPC Egress were unable to scale up, including from 0.\n- Customers using existing VPC Access Connectors may have experienced network slowdown due to VPC Access Connectors not being able to scale up. Customers were also unable to deploy new VPC Access Connectors.\n**Cloud Security Command Center:**\n- From 16:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, 25% of scheduled Attack Path Simulations failed globally, affecting 7% of onboarded organizations.\n- The attack exposure scores of findings were not updated and new attack paths were not created during this time for affected customers.\n- Customers could still view older attack exposure scores and attack paths during this time.\n**Cloud Shell:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Cloud Shell sessions failed to start globally. ~15% of Cloud Shell sessions failed to startup.\n**Cloud VPN:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud VPN resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Most existing tunnels were not affected, except that changes to learned BGP routes did not propagate during the outage.\n- Routine VPN maintenance operations which occurred during this time window broke the dataplane for a small number (1%) of customer tunnels, which should have recovered along with the control plane.\n**Cloud Workstations:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Workstation startup failed primarily across US regions. Around 25% of Workstations failed to startup.\n**Colab Enterprise:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Colab Enterprise NotebookRuntime operations: AssignNotebookRuntime, StartNotebookRuntime, UpgradeNotebookRuntime failed globally.\n**Firebase Test Lab:**\n- Between 15:50 and 17:50 PDT, new Cloud VM creations failed globally.\n- Around 17% of the total VM creation requests globally at the time encountered issues.\n100% of customer executions failed on x86 emulators, impacting external customer CI tests, causing a complete pause of executions on those devices.\n**Google App Engine Flexible:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers were unable to create App Engine Flex deployments and App Engine Flex deployments were unable to scale up.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\n- From 15:44 to 18:52 US/Pacific, Batch and streaming jobs became unhealthy in all regions: - New Dataflow jobs were not initialized successfully. - Already running Dataflow batch jobs experienced prolonged execution time - Already running Streaming jobs experienced elevated watermarks\n**Google Cloud Dataproc:**\n- From 15:34 to 18:16 US/Pacific, cluster creations failed globally.\n- Some cluster deletion workflows may have failed causing the corresponding VMs to not be entirely deleted. Our engineers have identified such VMs and performed a clean up after the service disruption was mitigated.\n**Google Cloud Deploy:**\n- From 15:39 to 17:28 US/Pacific, Cloud Deploy customers were experiencing significant latency or time outs for renders and deploys globally.\n**Google Cloud Functions:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers using Cloud Functions were unable to deploy globally.\n- Customers using existing VPC Access Connectors may have experienced network slowdown due to VPC Access Connectors not being able to scale up. Customers were also unable to deploy new VPC Access Connectors.\n**Google Cloud SQL:**\n- From 15:47 to 16:30 US/Pacific, all create, clone, restore operations were failing along with some patch & update operations. Some instances were impacted due to operational failures.\n- From 16:30 to 19:00 US/Pacific, recovery was started with 90% of the impacted instances restored or - recovered by 19:00. Failure rates were still elevated at about 10%.\n- All remaining instances were restored by 22:30 US/Pacific.\n**Google Compute Engine:**\n- From 15:45 to 16:45 US/Pacific, most of the networking requests experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n- From 16:00 to 17:15 US/Pacific, instance deletion and instance update operations experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n- From 15:45 to 18:15 US/Pacific, for instance group creation and deletion operations experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine:**\n- From 15:45 to 17:30 US/Pacific, GKE operations that created or updated a VM failed. These operations are cluster creation and deletion, node pool creation and deletion, node upgrade, scaling up existing nodepool, network configuration changes.\n**Infrastructure Manager:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:15 US/Pacific, deployment create/update/delete/unlock and preview create/delete operations degraded globally with increased latency and failures.\nCustomers could still view and export deployments, previews, revisions and resources.\n**Looker:**\n- From 15:50 to 17:30 US/Pacific, <0.2% of looker instances went down due to Cloud SQL DB connection failure.\n**Memorystore for Memcached:**\n- From 15:45 to 17:15 US/Pacific, Create, Update and Delete Memcache instance operations were failing across all regions.\n- Around 0.8% of existing nodes restarted with a downtime of approximately 50 minutes possibly because these VMs underwent live migration.\n**Memorystore for Redis:**\n- From 15:40 to 18:40 US/Pacific, newly started Redis instance VM nodes were unreachable for networking. These instances could have been newly created by the customer, created indirectly through a mutating change such as resource scaling or addition of a new replica, or created automatically due to routine system operations. Impacts would have manifested as Basic (unreplicated) instances being unusable, and on Standard instances it could have appeared as reduced reader capacity or outright instance unavailability. Some Redis instances experienced some long tail issues and eventually recovered at 20:05 US/Pacific.\n- In addition, mutating operations such as CreateInstance failed during this window.\n**Vertex AI Workbench:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, customers could not provision new instances. Existing instances were not affected.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\n- From 15:20 to 18:40 US/Pacific, all new endpoints (e.g., VMs, VPN gateways) and services (load balancers) received no network programming and observed packet loss to a majority of destinations.\n- 0.07% of VMs that were migrated during the outage also experienced connectivity loss for the duration of the service disruption.\n- Long-running VMs were also affected due to data plane overload in a few locations. Peak loss was 3% in us-east1-c and average loss was 0.05% across all Cloud zones.\n- Access to Google Services was degraded in a few GCE zones; a fraction (up to 25% in us-east4-c) of TCP connections were blackholed. Applications that retry with a different TCP source port would have experienced limited outages even in these Cloud zones.\n--------------------",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 8 May 2024, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial service outage in australia-southeast1-a for varying durations of up to 2 hours and 55 minutes. The full list of impacted products and services is detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nOn 8 May, at 18:44 US/Pacific, a public utility power issue resulted in an undervoltage condition followed by power loss that affected a portion of Google’s third-party data center in Sydney. As a result of this issue, the operating current exceeded the trip settings of the automatic transfer switch (ATS) units.\nATS units have trip settings to protect the load from electrical faults. Additionally, ATS units are configured in pairs to provide a redundant power path to the critical load.\nIn this case, both ATS units feeding the affected rows exceeded their trip settings due to overcurrent. Further investigation into the ATS units determined that they were configured with trip settings that were not in accordance with the site design.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via internal monitoring on Wednesday, 8 May at 18:55 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. On-site data center operations were engaged at 19:00 US/Pacific, and the scope of the power loss was confirmed at 19:22 US/Pacific.\nOn-site engineers restored power to the affected rows at 19:00 US/Pacific by manually closing breakers for both of the ATS units.\nOn Wednesday, 8 May at19:42 US/Pacific, network connectivity for the affected racks began recovering. All services had recovered by 21:55 US/Pacific with the exception of a very small percentage of Persistent Disk devices which required manual intervention.\nOn Thursday, 9 May at 07:47 US/Pacific, the public utility power issue was resolved.\nAll power had been switched back to utility feeds on Thursday, 9 May at 09:26 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* A case has been opened with the utility provider to determine the cause of the power event that led to the undervoltage condition.\n* Audit and update all ATS device settings if needed based on current site load.\n* Complete a full audit of all operational procedures for the Sydney third-party data center location.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Wednesday 8 May, from 18:45 to 21:40 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial service outage in the australia-southeast1-a zone.\n**Persistent Disk:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:45 US/Pacific, approximately 0.4% of Persistent Disk devices in australia-southeast1-a experienced failures for disk operations, including snapshots, clones, and attachments.\n* Approximately 0.05% of PD devices experienced extended impact and required manual intervention.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:55 US/Pacific, customers experienced increased latency for affected streaming jobs.\n* From 19:45 to 20:45 US/Pacific, some batch jobs took longer than normal to execute.\n* From 18:49 to 19:15 US/Pacific, a small number of new job submissions failed.\n**Google Cloud Pub/Sub:**\n* For a total of 13 minutes between 18:46 to 19:19 US/Pacific, affected customers experienced intermittent request error rates up to 1% and elevated message delivery latency.\n**Google BigQuery:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:50 US/Pacific, 0.8% of job failures for Job API and 5 minutes of failures for Metadata API.\n* From 19:00 to 19:20: 17% of projects experienced slower than normal performance.\n* From 21:25 to 22:25: over 10% of projects experienced slower than normal performance.\n**Google Compute Engine:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:30 US/Pacific, 11.8% of VMs in australia-southeast1-a were paused and restarted, and another 4.0% experienced pauses without restarting.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:43 US/Pacific, affected customers were unable to access their NFS filestore in the australia-southeast1-a zone.\n**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**\n* From 18:45 to 21:31 US/Pacific, affected customers experienced delays while creating new VMs and packet loss / unreachability for existing VMs. The VMs in australia-southeast1-a which went down could have faced delayed programming upon recreation. Roughly half of the traffic to australia-southeast1-a VMs was dropped.\n**Cloud SQL:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:45 US/Pacific, affected customers were unable to access their Cloud SQL instances in australia-southeast1-a. High Availability instances successfully failed over to other zones and recovered in 1-4 minutes. The majority of affected zonal instances were inaccessible for 20-30 minutes, with a few experiencing extended recovery times of up to 3 hours.\n**Cloud Logging:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:05 US/Pacific, affected customers may have experienced a small increase in error rates for inflight requests in this zone.\n* Cloud Logging is a regional service so the vast majority of the requests in the australia-southeast1 region were not affected.\n**Cloud Bigtable:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:10 US/Pacific, affected customers would have experienced high error rates in australia-southeast1-a.\n**Cloud Apigee:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:15 US/Pacific, there were multiple periods of impact ranging from 5 to 30 minutes, with error rates between 5% and 38% respectively, due to nodes restarting.\n* During the impact periods, customers may have experienced a “GKE cluster is currently undergoing repair\" error.\n**Memorystore for Redis**\n* From 18:46 to 21:31 US/Pacific, a subset of basic tier instances in australia-southeast1-a zone would have been unavailable.\n* Affected standard tier instances may have experienced brief unavailability as they failed over to replicas.\n**Dialogflow**\n* From 18:45 to 19:15 US/Pacific, affected customers would have experienced up to a 3% error rate in australia-southeast1.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\n* From 18:45 to approximately 19:45 US/Pacific, 14% of GKE clusters in australia-southeast1 were unavailable.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 8 May 2024, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial service outage in australia-southeast1-a for varying durations of up to 2 hours and 55 minutes. The full list of impacted products and services is detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nOn 8 May, at 18:44 US/Pacific, a public utility power issue resulted in an undervoltage condition followed by power loss that affected a portion of Google’s third-party data center in Sydney. As a result of this issue, the operating current exceeded the trip settings of the automatic transfer switch (ATS) units.\nATS units have trip settings to protect the load from electrical faults. Additionally, ATS units are configured in pairs to provide a redundant power path to the critical load.\nIn this case, both ATS units feeding the affected rows exceeded their trip settings due to overcurrent. Further investigation into the ATS units determined that they were configured with trip settings that were not in accordance with the site design.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via internal monitoring on Wednesday, 8 May at 18:55 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. On-site data center operations were engaged at 19:00 US/Pacific, and the scope of the power loss was confirmed at 19:22 US/Pacific.\nOn-site engineers restored power to the affected rows at 19:00 US/Pacific by manually closing breakers for both of the ATS units.\nOn Wednesday, 8 May at19:42 US/Pacific, network connectivity for the affected racks began recovering. All services had recovered by 21:55 US/Pacific with the exception of a very small percentage of Persistent Disk devices which required manual intervention.\nOn Thursday, 9 May at 07:47 US/Pacific, the public utility power issue was resolved.\nAll power had been switched back to utility feeds on Thursday, 9 May at 09:26 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* A case has been opened with the utility provider to determine the cause of the power event that led to the undervoltage condition.\n* Audit and update all ATS device settings if needed based on current site load.\n* Complete a full audit of all operational procedures for the Sydney third-party data center location.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Wednesday 8 May, from 18:45 to 21:40 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial service outage in the australia-southeast1-a zone.\n**Persistent Disk:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:45 US/Pacific, approximately 0.4% of Persistent Disk devices in australia-southeast1-a experienced failures for disk operations, including snapshots, clones, and attachments.\n* Approximately 0.05% of PD devices experienced extended impact and required manual intervention.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:55 US/Pacific, customers experienced increased latency for affected streaming jobs.\n* From 19:45 to 20:45 US/Pacific, some batch jobs took longer than normal to execute.\n* From 18:49 to 19:15 US/Pacific, a small number of new job submissions failed.\n**Google Cloud Pub/Sub:**\n* For a total of 13 minutes between 18:46 to 19:19 US/Pacific, affected customers experienced intermittent request error rates up to 1% and elevated message delivery latency.\n**Google BigQuery:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:50 US/Pacific, 0.8% of job failures for Job API and 5 minutes of failures for Metadata API.\n* From 19:00 to 19:20: 17% of projects experienced slower than normal performance.\n* From 21:25 to 22:25: over 10% of projects experienced slower than normal performance.\n**Google Compute Engine:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:30 US/Pacific, 11.8% of VMs in australia-southeast1-a were paused and restarted, and another 4.0% experienced pauses without restarting.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:43 US/Pacific, affected customers were unable to access their NFS filestore in the australia-southeast1-a zone.\n**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**\n* From 18:45 to 21:31 US/Pacific, affected customers experienced delays while creating new VMs and packet loss / unreachability for existing VMs. The VMs in australia-southeast1-a which went down could have faced delayed programming upon recreation. Roughly half of the traffic to australia-southeast1-a VMs was dropped.\n**Cloud SQL:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:45 US/Pacific, affected customers were unable to access their Cloud SQL instances in australia-southeast1-a. High Availability instances successfully failed over to other zones and recovered in 1-4 minutes. The majority of affected zonal instances were inaccessible for 20-30 minutes, with a few experiencing extended recovery times of up to 3 hours.\n**Cloud Logging:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:05 US/Pacific, affected customers may have experienced a small increase in error rates for inflight requests in this zone.\n* Cloud Logging is a regional service so the vast majority of the requests in the australia-southeast1 region were not affected.\n**Cloud Bigtable:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:10 US/Pacific, affected customers would have experienced high error rates in australia-southeast1-a.\n**Cloud Apigee:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:15 US/Pacific, there were multiple periods of impact ranging from 5 to 30 minutes, with error rates between 5% and 38% respectively, due to nodes restarting.\n* During the impact periods, customers may have experienced a “GKE cluster is currently undergoing repair\" error.\n**Memorystore for Redis**\n* From 18:46 to 21:31 US/Pacific, a subset of basic tier instances in australia-southeast1-a zone would have been unavailable.\n* Affected standard tier instances may have experienced brief unavailability as they failed over to replicas.\n**Dialogflow**\n* From 18:45 to 19:15 US/Pacific, affected customers would have experienced up to a 3% error rate in australia-southeast1.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\n* From 18:45 to approximately 19:45 US/Pacific, 14% of GKE clusters in australia-southeast1 were unavailable.",

This effect accumulated and further slowed down the system's processing and resulted in the jobs to remain in Queued status instead of progressing to Scheduled status.\nGoogle engineers were alerted by our internal monitoring and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature of impact was clear, our engineering team mitigated the impact by disabling new job scheduling, and cleared the stuck jobs by restarting them.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers from the affected region trying to use Batch experienced delays while changing the status of their batch jobs from Queued to Scheduled. As a workaround, impacted customers were advised to try submitting their jobs from another region wherever possible.",

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was due to an issue introduced by a recent change to the latest stable Container Operating System (COS) image used by Cloud Composer in one of its workloads.\nThe new version of the COS image (M113) moved from iptables-legacy to iptables-nft package as the default, which impacted Konlet (system executing containers)’s handling of iptables to break.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via our monitoring tools on 16 April at 09:17 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers reverted the recently introduced rollout.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Improve our monitoring systems to ensure that in the future during similar scenarios we would be notified quicker what could help with resolving an issue earlier.\n- Cloud Composer team will modify the approach of ingesting new container base images to regionalize it and be independent of the ongoing rollouts of the base image versions.\n- The process of intake and testing of container base images will be extended to make the testing more extensive.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nBetween 16 April 2024 from 02:20 to 17 April, 03:40 US/Pacific impacted customers might have experienced issues with:\n- Creating new Composer Environments with Private IP configuration failed. In total we observed < 200 customer projects where creations failed due to the issue.\n- Upgrades and resize operations for existing Composer Environments in the Private IP configuration failed. In total we observed < 20 environments with failed upgrades due to the issue.\n- Environments in Private IP configuration might have encountered issues with scaling for increased database-intensive workloads.\n- Existing Composer 2 Environments, if not modified, functioned correctly.\n- Customers who triggered an upgrade during an outage were facing an issue with the Composer environment which was unhealthy, including workloads with failed upgrades which could have caused ongoing performance issues.\n- Once the issue was mitigated, the impacted environments returned to the healthy state.\nDuring the outage customers were asked to refrain from performing upgrade operations until mitigation has been confirmed.\n**Additional Information for Customers:**\n- Fewer than 20 of the customer environments encountered upgrade failures and all of the customer environments with “Private IP” configuration that experienced upgrade failures during the incident will now upgrade successfully.\nIf you are one of the customers that experienced upgrade failure during the incident and still continue to have issues with further upgrades, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support for assistance with recovery.",

This was due to an inadvertent issue introduced by a recent change to the latest stable Container Operating System (COS) image used by Cloud Composer in one of its workloads.\nExisting Private IP environments continued to operate normally if they were not upgraded or resized.\nGoogle engineers executed a rollback of the change to mitigate the issue on 17 April 2024 at 03:40 US/Pacific.\nGoogle will complete a full Incident Report in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Impacted users experienced issues with creating new Composer Environments, upgrades, and resize operations for existing Composer Environments in Private IP configuration.\n- Composer environments with failed upgrades were unhealthy and workloads could fail or experience performance issues\n- Environments might have encountered issues with scaling for increase database-intensive workloads\n**Additional details:**\n- Less than 0.25% of the customer environments encountered upgrade failures and some of the customer environments with “Private IP” configuration that experienced upgrade failures during the incident will now upgrade successfully.\n- A few environments may still experience failures on further upgrades. These environments are still functioning normally and will continue serving workloads without any issues. Our engineers are working internally to identify these environments and take additional actions so that they can be further upgraded successfully. These actions are expected to be completed by early next week.\nIf you are one of the customers that experienced upgrade failure during the incident and still continue to have issues with further upgrades, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support for assistance with recovery. Alternatively, you can recreate these environments.\n--------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nBetween 16 and 17 April 2024, Cloud Composer users experienced an elevated failure rate when creating, resizing or upgrading to newer versions of Cloud Composer 2 Environments with “Private IP” configuration for a duration of 1 day, 1 hour and 20 minutes.\nExisting Private IP environments continued to operate normally if they were not upgraded or resized.\nTo our Cloud Composer customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption: we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was due to an issue introduced by a recent change to the latest stable Container Operating System (COS) image used by Cloud Composer in one of its workloads.\nThe new version of the COS image (M113) moved from iptables-legacy to iptables-nft package as the default, which impacted Konlet (system executing containers)’s handling of iptables to break.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via our monitoring tools on 16 April at 09:17 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers reverted the recently introduced rollout.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Improve our monitoring systems to ensure that in the future during similar scenarios we would be notified quicker what could help with resolving an issue earlier.\n- Cloud Composer team will modify the approach of ingesting new container base images to regionalize it and be independent of the ongoing rollouts of the base image versions.\n- The process of intake and testing of container base images will be extended to make the testing more extensive.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nBetween 16 April 2024 from 02:20 to 17 April, 03:40 US/Pacific impacted customers might have experienced issues with:\n- Creating new Composer Environments with Private IP configuration failed. In total we observed < 200 customer projects where creations failed due to the issue.\n- Upgrades and resize operations for existing Composer Environments in the Private IP configuration failed. In total we observed < 20 environments with failed upgrades due to the issue.\n- Environments in Private IP configuration might have encountered issues with scaling for increased database-intensive workloads.\n- Existing Composer 2 Environments, if not modified, functioned correctly.\n- Customers who triggered an upgrade during an outage were facing an issue with the Composer environment which was unhealthy, including workloads with failed upgrades which could have caused ongoing performance issues.\n- Once the issue was mitigated, the impacted environments returned to the healthy state.\nDuring the outage customers were asked to refrain from performing upgrade operations until mitigation has been confirmed.\n**Additional Information for Customers:**\n- Fewer than 20 of the customer environments encountered upgrade failures and all of the customer environments with “Private IP” configuration that experienced upgrade failures during the incident will now upgrade successfully.\nIf you are one of the customers that experienced upgrade failure during the incident and still continue to have issues with further upgrades, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support for assistance with recovery.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause was related to a recent rollout that improperly configured an access transparency check for some of Chronicle Security’s back-end data processing pipelines.\nGoogle Engineers completed a roll back of the change that introduced the issue at 18:09, which allowed the affected data pipelines to run. All of the affected data pipelines had successfully completed by 30 March 2024 at 05:26, fully resolving impact.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers experienced delays in data availability in all regions for multiple Chronicle system components and product features, including Entity Graph, BigQuery Export, UEBA Simple Analytics, and Log Export.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support .\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**First Impact Window Start:** 20 March 2024 09:58\n**First Impact Window end:** 20 March 2024 11:40\n**Duration:** 1 hour, 42 minutes\n**Second Impact Window Start:** 20 March 2024 14:15\n**Second Impact Window end:** 20 March 2024 14:45\n**Duration:** 30 minutes\nCumulative impact duration: 2 hours, 12 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n* Dialogflow ES\n* Dialogflow CX\n* Cloud Speech-to-Text\n* Agent Assist\n**Regions/Zones:**\n* Global\n* Regions: us-east1, us-central1, us-west1, northamerica-northeast1 [1]\n**Description:**\nDialogflow ES, Dialogflow CX, Cloud Speech-to-Text, and Agent Assist experienced two periods of elevated errors for streaming data plane traffic for durations of 1 hours, 42 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to a recent configuration change for an internal critical dependency that serves as a backend gateway for the affected products.\n**Customer Impact:**\nImpacted customers encountered multiple periods of internal or unavailable errors for streaming API actions (StreamingAnalyzeContent, StreamingDetectIntent).\n* 20 March 2024 09:58 - 11:40 US/Pacific (1 hour, 42 minutes)\n* 20 March 2024 14:15 - 14:45 US/Pacific (30 minutes)\n**Additional details:**\nOn 20 March 2024, at 11:40 US/Pacific, Google engineers reversed the configuration change to the internal critical dependency, which temporarily alleviated the impact while a permanent solution was being developed.\nAt 14:15 US/Pacific, a previously scheduled rollout for the dependency service completed, unintentionally reverting the temporary mitigation that engineers had put in place. Engineers reapplied the temporary mitigation at 14:45 US/Pacific.\nOn 21 March 2024, at 16:31 US/Pacific, engineers effectively implemented a new version of the dependency service that includes the necessary mitigation measures, successfully preventing any further regressions.\nReference\n* [1] https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support .\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**First Impact Window Start:** 20 March 2024 09:58\n**First Impact Window end:** 20 March 2024 11:40\n**Duration:** 1 hour, 42 minutes\n**Second Impact Window Start:** 20 March 2024 14:15\n**Second Impact Window end:** 20 March 2024 14:45\n**Duration:** 30 minutes\nCumulative impact duration: 2 hours, 12 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n* Dialogflow ES\n* Dialogflow CX\n* Cloud Speech-to-Text\n* Agent Assist\n**Regions/Zones:**\n* Global\n* Regions: us-east1, us-central1, us-west1, northamerica-northeast1 [1]\n**Description:**\nDialogflow ES, Dialogflow CX, Cloud Speech-to-Text, and Agent Assist experienced two periods of elevated errors for streaming data plane traffic for durations of 1 hours, 42 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to a recent configuration change for an internal critical dependency that serves as a backend gateway for the affected products.\n**Customer Impact:**\nImpacted customers encountered multiple periods of internal or unavailable errors for streaming API actions (StreamingAnalyzeContent, StreamingDetectIntent).\n* 20 March 2024 09:58 - 11:40 US/Pacific (1 hour, 42 minutes)\n* 20 March 2024 14:15 - 14:45 US/Pacific (30 minutes)\n**Additional details:**\nOn 20 March 2024, at 11:40 US/Pacific, Google engineers reversed the configuration change to the internal critical dependency, which temporarily alleviated the impact while a permanent solution was being developed.\nAt 14:15 US/Pacific, a previously scheduled rollout for the dependency service completed, unintentionally reverting the temporary mitigation that engineers had put in place. Engineers reapplied the temporary mitigation at 14:45 US/Pacific.\nOn 21 March 2024, at 16:31 US/Pacific, engineers effectively implemented a new version of the dependency service that includes the necessary mitigation measures, successfully preventing any further regressions.\nReference\n* [1] https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail",

Please note that Google worked with the appropriate partner to resolve the underlying issue. This is the final version of the report and no further information will be provided here. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 12 March 2024 08:00\n**Incident End:** 12 March 2024 14:55\n**Duration:** 6 hours, 55 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\n**Regions/Zones:** [All GPU regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/gpu-regions-zones)\n**Description:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine experienced elevated errors due to failures in downloading some NVIDIA GPU drivers for use with Container-Optimized OS (COS) for a duration of 6 hours, 55 minutes. These failures in downloading the GPU drivers led to node unavailability in some cases and impacted customers using T4, L4, H100 80GB and A100 GPUs, [COS milestone](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes) 105 or above, and those who were attempting to install GPU driver versions R525 and above.\nFrom the preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was an access issue to the storage bucket required for driver downloads. This is owned by our partner that supplies these GPU drivers. To limit the impact, Google Cloud took swift actions while the issue was happening, by halting automatic node recreations (which attempt GPU driver downloads) until the issue was mitigated. Other GKE features continued to operate normally without disruption.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* GKE users encountered an error \"Failed to download GPU driver installer, status: 403 Forbidden\" on the GPU node when installing affected GPU drivers using COS. In some cases, the GPU driver download failures led to node unavailability.\n* GPU driver downloads for GPU models P4, P100, V100, K80 were unaffected.\n--------",

Affected Nodes that are newly created or recreated have non functional GPU drivers preventing functioning of workloads using the drivers. Some GPU drivers are unaffected (P4, P100, V100, K80).\nOur engineering team continues to work towards resolving the driver fetching issue.\nWe will provide more information by Tuesday, 2024-03-12 18:00 US/Pacific.\nWe apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.\nDiagnosis: GKE users will see error messages on the GPU node when installing the GPU driver of this nature - \"Failed to download GPU driver installer, status: 403 Forbidden\".\nWorkaround: None at this time. However, the issue can be mitigated by avoiding recreation of existing Nodes running GPUs. Note GCP has halted automatic Node recreation as a partial mitigation.",

      "text": "# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note that Google worked with the appropriate partner to resolve the underlying issue. This is the final version of the report and no further information will be provided here. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 12 March 2024 08:00\n**Incident End:** 12 March 2024 14:55\n**Duration:** 6 hours, 55 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\n**Regions/Zones:** [All GPU regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/gpu-regions-zones)\n**Description:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine experienced elevated errors due to failures in downloading some NVIDIA GPU drivers for use with Container-Optimized OS (COS) for a duration of 6 hours, 55 minutes. These failures in downloading the GPU drivers led to node unavailability in some cases and impacted customers using T4, L4, H100 80GB and A100 GPUs, [COS milestone](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes) 105 or above, and those who were attempting to install GPU driver versions R525 and above.\nFrom the preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was an access issue to the storage bucket required for driver downloads. This is owned by our partner that supplies these GPU drivers. To limit the impact, Google Cloud took swift actions while the issue was happening, by halting automatic node recreations (which attempt GPU driver downloads) until the issue was mitigated. Other GKE features continued to operate normally without disruption.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* GKE users encountered an error \"Failed to download GPU driver installer, status: 403 Forbidden\" on the GPU node when installing affected GPU drivers using COS. In some cases, the GPU driver download failures led to node unavailability.\n* GPU driver downloads for GPU models P4, P100, V100, K80 were unaffected.\n--------",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 14 February 2024 from 09:45 AM to 12:52 PM US/Pacific, Google Cloud customers in us-west1 experienced control plane unavailability because of elevated latencies and errors. In addition, a few services experienced data plane unavailability for the same reason. The full list of impacted products and services are detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nMost Google Cloud products and services use a regional metadata store to support their internal operations. The metadata store supports critical functions such as servicing customer requests and handling scale, load balancing, admin operations and for retrieving/storing metadata including server location information.\nThe regional metadata store continuously manages load by automatically adjusting compute capacity in response to changes in demand. When usage increases, additional resources are added and load is also balanced automatically. However, an unexpected spike in demand exceeded the system’s ability to quickly provision additional resources. As a result, multiple Google Cloud products and services in the region experienced elevated latencies and errors until the unexpected load was isolated.\n## Remediation and Prevention/Detection\nGoogle engineers were alerted to this problem by our internal monitoring system and throttled the spiking workloads on the underlying regional metadata store. This allowed Google Cloud products and services to read/write state at a normal rate allowing for healthy servicing of customer requests after the backlog of operations on the regional metadata store were processed.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Improve monitoring and alerting for an earlier detection of unexpected spikes in the regional metadata stores.\n- Enhance the ability of regional data stores to automatically throttle workloads more aggressively when experiencing unexpected spikes.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Google Compute Engine\n* From 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM US/Pacific, a number of GCE APIs returned internal or timeout errors in the us-west1 region, across all zones. The overall error rate for most APIs remained around 1% with errors affecting around 33% of projects in the region.\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, less than 0.004% VMs running in the region crashed, 80% of the crashed VMs recovered while 20% of the crashed VMs experienced delays in rescheduling.\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, about 1% of read/write requests in the region for [guest attributes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/overview#guest_attributes) failed or experienced latency exceeding 1 second.\n### Google Cloud Pub/Sub Lite\n* From 10:05 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced elevated end-to-end latency and publish request latency in us-west1. At peak impact, 65% of publish requests in the region failed with aborted, canceled, deadline exceeded, or unavailable errors, affecting up to 47% of projects publishing in the region. Resource administrative operations also displayed unavailability in the region.\n### App Engine Standard\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~6% of customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Google App Engine apps.\n### Cloud Functions\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~6% of customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Cloud Function apps.\n### Cloud Run\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~2% of Customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Cloud Run apps.\n### Dialogflow CX\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:45 AM US/Pacific, a percentage of Dialogflow requests returned internal or timeout errors in the us-west1 region. The error rate stayed below 5% before peaking at 100% around 11:00 US/Pacific.\n### Vertex AI products:\n* From about 10:15 AM to 11:35 AM US/Pacific, all Vertex AI services that heavily rely on metadata store operations including Online Prediction, Training, and Featurestore, ML Metadata and Notebooks experienced ~50% error rates (spiking to near 100% at times) in the region.\n### Google Cloud Pub/Sub\n* From 09:57 AM to 11:26 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Pub/Sub customers with traffic in us-west1 experienced publish errors and unavailability. The publish error rate peaked at ~99% for customers with publish traffic in us-west1. In addition, backlog stats metrics were unavailable for some customers who did not have publish or subscribe traffic in us-west1.\n### Cloud Memorystore\n* From 10:05 AM and 11:35 AM US/Pacific, customers creating, updating, deleting, importing, or exporting Redis Standalone or Cluster instances in us-west1 may have experienced failures. Around 17% of such requests failed with timeouts or internal errors.\n### Eventarc\n* From 10:30 AM and 11:30 AM US/Pacific Eventarc customers in us-west1 experienced event delivery delays for up to 50 minutes as we saw event publish errors in our dataplane that peaked at 100%. There are high error ratios and latencies for all control plane long running operations with peak error rate at 100% and peak latency of 55 minutes.\n### Dataproc Metastore\n* From 10:00 AM and 11:45 AM US/Pacific, all control plane operations were sporadically returning an internal or deadline exceeded error (differing ratios throughout the outage) in the region. The peak impact was from around 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific where only around 3.33% of operations were completed with OK.\n### Google Cloud Tasks\n* From 10:40 AM and 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Tasks’s main data operation (CreateTask) returned DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error for all requests in us-west1. This means customers in this region were not able to buffer Tasks and, subsequently, our system was not able to dispatch them.\n### Cloud Build\n* From 9:45 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, using Cloud Build to create or retry builds may have failed in us-west1. ~15-20% of requests failed during the issue.\n### Cloud SQL\n* From 10:06 AM to 11:46 AM US/Pacific, Many operations requiring the regional metadata store in us-west1 timed out or failed, this affected Cloud SQL instance creations or any modifications to existing us-west1 instances. 30% of instance creations failed, 10% of export operations failed, and <10% of update operations failed in us-west1.\n### Speech-to-text\n* From 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Speech-to-Text (STT) experienced a spike in server errors in us-west1. The issue primarily affected control plane traffic to client STT resources (e.g. CreateRecognizer) which experienced a spike in INTERNAL server errors. At peak, around 10% of Create.* traffic or around 0.5QPS of traffic returned such errors.\n### Cloud Load Balancing\n* From 9:50 AM to 12:52 PM US/Pacific, new Cloud Load Balancer creation was failing for load balancers with backends in the us-west1 region. Also, configuration changes on the same family of products could not be made. The data plane was not affected.\n### Cloud Networking\n* From 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud NAT, Cloud Router, Cloud Interconnect, and Cloud VPN users experienced time-outs for add/delete/modify operations in us-west1 region .\n* Existing programming and forwarding rules were not impacted.\n### Cloud Deploy\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Deploy releases and rollouts in the region were either delayed or failed due to the inability to create builds with Cloud Build which was also affected by the regional metadata store issue. Whether the release/rollout was delayed or failed depended on whether retrying was successful. We also saw errors creating or updating Cloud Deploy resources due to metadata store RPC errors at the time.\n### Workflows\n* From 10:10 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Workflows experienced latency and availability issues in the us-west1 region, This issue impacted ~2% of customer projects and customers experienced internal errors like deadline_exceeded: metadata store reads could not be validated after transaction function returned error: context deadline exceeded. Example methods that were impacted: CancelExecutions, CreateExecutions, CreateWorkflows and TriggerPubsubExecution.\n### Cloud Logging\n* From 9:45 AM to 12:45 PM US/Pacific, Cloud Logs ingestion storage was delayed in the us-west1 region. This issue impacted ~12.5% of global buckets, but regional buckets do not seem to have been delayed.\n### Dataform\n* From 09:55 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, our business critical consumer API availability had the lowest availability of 14.29% in us-west1 during the metadata store outage.\n* The metadata store RPC Error Ratio had the highest of 57.6807%. This metadata store is used for executing customer's release & workflow schedules.\n### Certificate Authority Service\n* From 9:50 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, 3% of overall traffic to Certificate Authority Service in us-west1 experienced slowness and errors for control and data plane operations. Customers experienced an error rate of 85% for Create Certificate Revocation List requests, while other operations were affected at a rate between 1-15%.\n### VPC and Serverless VPC Access\n* From 9:48 AM to 11:16 AM US/Pacific Serverless VPC Access customers in us-west1 were unable to create, delete, modify or list Serverless VPC Access Connectors. We saw error rates hovering from 50% to 90% where customers would see DEADLINE_EXCEEDED. Serverless VPC Access Connector proxying functionality was unaffected by this incident.\n### Cloud Dataflow\n* From 10:03 AM to 12:22 PM US/Pacific, Dataflow customers in us-west1 experienced job submission failures peaking at 100%. ~6% of running streaming jobs experienced unusually high system watermarks. Up to 100% of running batch jobs were stuck and failed to make progress during the outage.\n### Cloud Key Management Service\n* From 10:32 AM to 11:24 AM US/Pacific, ~0.0046% of overall traffic for Cloud Key Management Service in us-west1 served errors (INTERNAL, UNAVAILABLE, or DEADLINE_EXCEEDED) for control and crypto operations.\n* Customers experienced an error rate of 0.000189% for Crypto operations (within SLO) due to serving path redundancy with another storage system.\n* Customers experienced an error rate of 0.28% for Control operations, mostly (CreateCryptoKey, CreateKeyRing, DestroyCryptoKeyVersion) were affected, potentially any metadata read/write operations could have been affected as well. Around ~0.0219% of resource projects are believed to have been affected during the outage.\n### Persistent Disk\n* From 10:35 AM to 12:10 PM US/Pacific, some Persistent Disk deletion flows were stuck in the us-west1 region. Affected customers would have perceived very long running disk delete operations without any errors. Less than 0.01 percent of projects were affected.\n### Cloud Data Loss Prevention\n* From 10:35 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, around 60% of total requests encountered errors in us-west1.\n### Cloud Dataproc\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:07 PM US/Pacific, Dataproc customers were unable to perform cluster and batch operations in us-west1. At peak impact between 10:30 AM to 11:32 AM US/Pacific, 65% of requests to Dataproc returned errors mostly DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, with some requests like create cluster returning a 100% error rate during this period.\n### Dataplex Catalog\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:35 AM US/Pacific, Dataplex Catalog customers in us-west1 were unable to create, delete, modify, list or search data stored in Dataplex Catalog. Error rates up to 90% of requests where customers would see a server error, and increased latency overall. Customers using other regions were not affected by this incident.\n### Cloud Composer\n* From 9:48 AM to ~11:28 US/Pacific, some Cloud Composer customers in us-west1 experienced issues performing control plane operations like creating/deleting/updating environments and operations requiring control plane like snapshots could have been also impacted. Composer dataplane (aka Composer environment) was operating fine.\n* The problem was discovered by Composer probers and there is an impact on SLO of Composer Control Plane API availability.\n### Instances API\n* From 10:35 AM to 11:50 AM US/Pacific, all Snapshot Schedules for Persistent Disks in us-west1 were not created according to schedule and were created with delay.\n------\n***Added on 28 Feb 2024***\n### Document AI Warehouse\n* From 11:00 AM to 11:17 AM US/Pacific, the API returned server and client error messages in the US/multi-region.\n* During the impact window, all API requests experienced elevated error rate. Overall error rate intermittently spiked beyond 90%.\n### Google Kubernetes Engine\n* From 10:47 AM to 11:32 AM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced API call failures and in some cases cluster unavailability in the us-west1 region.\n* The API call failure rate peaked at 25% of API calls to the us-west1 region and the cluster unavailability in the us-west1 region peaked at 1% of clusters.\n### GKE Fleet Management\n* From 09:52 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced API call failures to add GKE clusters into Fleet in the us-west1 region.\n* The API call failure rate peaked at 100% of API calls to the us-west1 region on the Fleet (GKE Hub) services\n------\nTo summarize, multiple Google Cloud Products experienced unavailability and/or elevated error rates for services in the us-west1 region during this issue. This is the final version of the Incident Report.\n------\n------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 14 February 2024 from 09:45 AM to 12:52 PM US/Pacific, Google Cloud customers in us-west1 experienced control plane unavailability because of elevated latencies and errors. In addition, a few services experienced data plane unavailability for the same reason. The full list of impacted products and services are detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nMost Google Cloud products and services use a regional metadata store to support their internal operations. The metadata store supports critical functions such as servicing customer requests and handling scale, load balancing, admin operations and for retrieving/storing metadata including server location information.\nThe regional metadata store continuously manages load by automatically adjusting compute capacity in response to changes in demand. When usage increases, additional resources are added and load is also balanced automatically. However, an unexpected spike in demand exceeded the system’s ability to quickly provision additional resources. As a result, multiple Google Cloud products and services in the region experienced elevated latencies and errors until the unexpected load was isolated.\n## Remediation and Prevention/Detection\nGoogle engineers were alerted to this problem by our internal monitoring system and throttled the spiking workloads on the underlying regional metadata store. This allowed Google Cloud products and services to read/write state at a normal rate allowing for healthy servicing of customer requests after the backlog of operations on the regional metadata store were processed.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Improve monitoring and alerting for an earlier detection of unexpected spikes in the regional metadata stores.\n- Enhance the ability of regional data stores to automatically throttle workloads more aggressively when experiencing unexpected spikes.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Google Compute Engine\n* From 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM US/Pacific, a number of GCE APIs returned internal or timeout errors in the us-west1 region, across all zones. The overall error rate for most APIs remained around 1% with errors affecting around 33% of projects in the region.\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, less than 0.004% VMs running in the region crashed, 80% of the crashed VMs recovered while 20% of the crashed VMs experienced delays in rescheduling.\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, about 1% of read/write requests in the region for [guest attributes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/overview#guest_attributes) failed or experienced latency exceeding 1 second.\n### Google Cloud Pub/Sub Lite\n* From 10:05 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced elevated end-to-end latency and publish request latency in us-west1. At peak impact, 65% of publish requests in the region failed with aborted, canceled, deadline exceeded, or unavailable errors, affecting up to 47% of projects publishing in the region. Resource administrative operations also displayed unavailability in the region.\n### App Engine Standard\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~6% of customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Google App Engine apps.\n### Cloud Functions\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~6% of customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Cloud Function apps.\n### Cloud Run\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~2% of Customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Cloud Run apps.\n### Dialogflow CX\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:45 AM US/Pacific, a percentage of Dialogflow requests returned internal or timeout errors in the us-west1 region. The error rate stayed below 5% before peaking at 100% around 11:00 US/Pacific.\n### Vertex AI products:\n* From about 10:15 AM to 11:35 AM US/Pacific, all Vertex AI services that heavily rely on metadata store operations including Online Prediction, Training, and Featurestore, ML Metadata and Notebooks experienced ~50% error rates (spiking to near 100% at times) in the region.\n### Google Cloud Pub/Sub\n* From 09:57 AM to 11:26 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Pub/Sub customers with traffic in us-west1 experienced publish errors and unavailability. The publish error rate peaked at ~99% for customers with publish traffic in us-west1. In addition, backlog stats metrics were unavailable for some customers who did not have publish or subscribe traffic in us-west1.\n### Cloud Memorystore\n* From 10:05 AM and 11:35 AM US/Pacific, customers creating, updating, deleting, importing, or exporting Redis Standalone or Cluster instances in us-west1 may have experienced failures. Around 17% of such requests failed with timeouts or internal errors.\n### Eventarc\n* From 10:30 AM and 11:30 AM US/Pacific Eventarc customers in us-west1 experienced event delivery delays for up to 50 minutes as we saw event publish errors in our dataplane that peaked at 100%. There are high error ratios and latencies for all control plane long running operations with peak error rate at 100% and peak latency of 55 minutes.\n### Dataproc Metastore\n* From 10:00 AM and 11:45 AM US/Pacific, all control plane operations were sporadically returning an internal or deadline exceeded error (differing ratios throughout the outage) in the region. The peak impact was from around 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific where only around 3.33% of operations were completed with OK.\n### Google Cloud Tasks\n* From 10:40 AM and 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Tasks’s main data operation (CreateTask) returned DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error for all requests in us-west1. This means customers in this region were not able to buffer Tasks and, subsequently, our system was not able to dispatch them.\n### Cloud Build\n* From 9:45 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, using Cloud Build to create or retry builds may have failed in us-west1. ~15-20% of requests failed during the issue.\n### Cloud SQL\n* From 10:06 AM to 11:46 AM US/Pacific, Many operations requiring the regional metadata store in us-west1 timed out or failed, this affected Cloud SQL instance creations or any modifications to existing us-west1 instances. 30% of instance creations failed, 10% of export operations failed, and <10% of update operations failed in us-west1.\n### Speech-to-text\n* From 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Speech-to-Text (STT) experienced a spike in server errors in us-west1. The issue primarily affected control plane traffic to client STT resources (e.g. CreateRecognizer) which experienced a spike in INTERNAL server errors. At peak, around 10% of Create.* traffic or around 0.5QPS of traffic returned such errors.\n### Cloud Load Balancing\n* From 9:50 AM to 12:52 PM US/Pacific, new Cloud Load Balancer creation was failing for load balancers with backends in the us-west1 region. Also, configuration changes on the same family of products could not be made. The data plane was not affected.\n### Cloud Networking\n* From 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud NAT, Cloud Router, Cloud Interconnect, and Cloud VPN users experienced time-outs for add/delete/modify operations in us-west1 region .\n* Existing programming and forwarding rules were not impacted.\n### Cloud Deploy\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Deploy releases and rollouts in the region were either delayed or failed due to the inability to create builds with Cloud Build which was also affected by the regional metadata store issue. Whether the release/rollout was delayed or failed depended on whether retrying was successful. We also saw errors creating or updating Cloud Deploy resources due to metadata store RPC errors at the time.\n### Workflows\n* From 10:10 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Workflows experienced latency and availability issues in the us-west1 region, This issue impacted ~2% of customer projects and customers experienced internal errors like deadline_exceeded: metadata store reads could not be validated after transaction function returned error: context deadline exceeded. Example methods that were impacted: CancelExecutions, CreateExecutions, CreateWorkflows and TriggerPubsubExecution.\n### Cloud Logging\n* From 9:45 AM to 12:45 PM US/Pacific, Cloud Logs ingestion storage was delayed in the us-west1 region. This issue impacted ~12.5% of global buckets, but regional buckets do not seem to have been delayed.\n### Dataform\n* From 09:55 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, our business critical consumer API availability had the lowest availability of 14.29% in us-west1 during the metadata store outage.\n* The metadata store RPC Error Ratio had the highest of 57.6807%. This metadata store is used for executing customer's release & workflow schedules.\n### Certificate Authority Service\n* From 9:50 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, 3% of overall traffic to Certificate Authority Service in us-west1 experienced slowness and errors for control and data plane operations. Customers experienced an error rate of 85% for Create Certificate Revocation List requests, while other operations were affected at a rate between 1-15%.\n### VPC and Serverless VPC Access\n* From 9:48 AM to 11:16 AM US/Pacific Serverless VPC Access customers in us-west1 were unable to create, delete, modify or list Serverless VPC Access Connectors. We saw error rates hovering from 50% to 90% where customers would see DEADLINE_EXCEEDED. Serverless VPC Access Connector proxying functionality was unaffected by this incident.\n### Cloud Dataflow\n* From 10:03 AM to 12:22 PM US/Pacific, Dataflow customers in us-west1 experienced job submission failures peaking at 100%. ~6% of running streaming jobs experienced unusually high system watermarks. Up to 100% of running batch jobs were stuck and failed to make progress during the outage.\n### Cloud Key Management Service\n* From 10:32 AM to 11:24 AM US/Pacific, ~0.0046% of overall traffic for Cloud Key Management Service in us-west1 served errors (INTERNAL, UNAVAILABLE, or DEADLINE_EXCEEDED) for control and crypto operations.\n* Customers experienced an error rate of 0.000189% for Crypto operations (within SLO) due to serving path redundancy with another storage system.\n* Customers experienced an error rate of 0.28% for Control operations, mostly (CreateCryptoKey, CreateKeyRing, DestroyCryptoKeyVersion) were affected, potentially any metadata read/write operations could have been affected as well. Around ~0.0219% of resource projects are believed to have been affected during the outage.\n### Persistent Disk\n* From 10:35 AM to 12:10 PM US/Pacific, some Persistent Disk deletion flows were stuck in the us-west1 region. Affected customers would have perceived very long running disk delete operations without any errors. Less than 0.01 percent of projects were affected.\n### Cloud Data Loss Prevention\n* From 10:35 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, around 60% of total requests encountered errors in us-west1.\n### Cloud Dataproc\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:07 PM US/Pacific, Dataproc customers were unable to perform cluster and batch operations in us-west1. At peak impact between 10:30 AM to 11:32 AM US/Pacific, 65% of requests to Dataproc returned errors mostly DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, with some requests like create cluster returning a 100% error rate during this period.\n### Dataplex Catalog\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:35 AM US/Pacific, Dataplex Catalog customers in us-west1 were unable to create, delete, modify, list or search data stored in Dataplex Catalog. Error rates up to 90% of requests where customers would see a server error, and increased latency overall. Customers using other regions were not affected by this incident.\n### Cloud Composer\n* From 9:48 AM to ~11:28 US/Pacific, some Cloud Composer customers in us-west1 experienced issues performing control plane operations like creating/deleting/updating environments and operations requiring control plane like snapshots could have been also impacted. Composer dataplane (aka Composer environment) was operating fine.\n* The problem was discovered by Composer probers and there is an impact on SLO of Composer Control Plane API availability.\n### Instances API\n* From 10:35 AM to 11:50 AM US/Pacific, all Snapshot Schedules for Persistent Disks in us-west1 were not created according to schedule and were created with delay.\n------\n***Added on 28 Feb 2024***\n### Document AI Warehouse\n* From 11:00 AM to 11:17 AM US/Pacific, the API returned server and client error messages in the US/multi-region.\n* During the impact window, all API requests experienced elevated error rate. Overall error rate intermittently spiked beyond 90%.\n### Google Kubernetes Engine\n* From 10:47 AM to 11:32 AM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced API call failures and in some cases cluster unavailability in the us-west1 region.\n* The API call failure rate peaked at 25% of API calls to the us-west1 region and the cluster unavailability in the us-west1 region peaked at 1% of clusters.\n### GKE Fleet Management\n* From 09:52 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced API call failures to add GKE clusters into Fleet in the us-west1 region.\n* The API call failure rate peaked at 100% of API calls to the us-west1 region on the Fleet (GKE Hub) services\n------\nTo summarize, multiple Google Cloud Products experienced unavailability and/or elevated error rates for services in the us-west1 region during this issue. This is the final version of the Incident Report.\n------\n------",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 7 February 2024, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial zonal service outage in the europe-west8-b zone for a duration of 1 hour, 8 minutes. To our customers whose services were impacted during this service outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe europe-west8 region recently received a networking upgrade to increase capacity and improve resilience. In order to minimize the risk, Google executes these as \"make-before-break,\" adding new capacity before decommissioning old capacity. The final step of this upgrade was to remove now-unused fiber connections between zones in the region. Deployment automation creates work orders for onsite technicians to remove unused fiber cabling from network devices and fiber patch panels.\nOn 7 February 2024, between 02:21 and 02:46 US/Pacific, onsite technicians performing this planned network maintenance inadvertently unplugged several fibers that were adjacent to those in the work order, but still in use for production traffic. As a result, a portion of the europe-west8-b zone unintentionally became isolated from a portion of the backbone network at 02:46 US/Pacific.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the partial outage via internal monitoring on 7 February 2024, 02:56 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers began reverting the fiber changes and restoring network capacity at 03:52 US/Pacific.\nSufficient capacity to serve customer traffic was restored by 03:54 US/Pacific, mitigating impact to the affected products. Full capacity was restored by 04:07 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence of this incident. The following actions have been identified:\n* Google engineers have paused all work of this kind globally, starting on 8 February 2024. This pause will remain in effect until the actions below have been implemented to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n* Complete the rollout of an enhanced physical work safety program, which includes updates to the current process for execution of planned work related to interfaces or devices serving customer traffic. The following action items within that program are relevant to this incident: * Creation of an automated notification system for the start / end of planned work related to interfaces or devices serving customer traffic. * Division of planned work into execution batches. * Require operational team supervision and monitoring for planned work. * Add multi-step verification of traffic status before fibers are disconnected. * Include additional controls as part of working procedures for the execution of critical tasks to ensure compliance with documented processes.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 7 February 2024, from 02:46 to 03:54 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial zonal service outage for europe-west8-b. Affected services included:\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\n* GKE clusters in europe-west8-b were unavailable.\n* Customers may also have experienced failures when attempting to create, delete, or modify VMs in the affected zone.\n**Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)**\n* Cloud KMS experienced a partial zonal outage for services in europe-west8-b, including Hardware Security Module (HSM), External Key Manager (EKM), Secret Manager, and Private CA.\n**Google Cloud Bigtable**\n* Customers experienced a service outage with non-high availability instances in europe-west8-b for the duration of the outage.\n**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**\n* VPC customers may have experienced increased packet loss in the affected zone.\n**Google Cloud Deploy**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b would have experienced errors creating rollouts and releases.\n**Google Compute Engine**\n* VMs in a subset of europe-west8-b were unreachable for the duration of the outage.\n* VM creations and deletions in europe-west8-c started failing as services failed over to that zone.\n**Persistent Disk (PD)**\n* PD devices in a subset of europe-west8-b would have been unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n* PD services related to snapshots, creation of new disks, and image creation for the affected zone would have experienced failures.\n* A small number of VMs with Persistent Disks in a different zone within the region saw guest errors.\n**Google Cloud Networking**\n* Cloud NAT, Cloud Interconnect, Cloud VPN, Cloud VR were unavailable for europe-west8-b.\n* Cloud Network programming was delayed for all customers in the europe-west8-b zone.\n**Service Directory**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b experienced read and write errors for the duration of the outage.\n**Traffic Director**\n* Stale configurations and load balancing assignments for all customers in europe-west8-b. This would have appeared as configuration updates not propagating and load balancing assignments not reacting to changes in load.\n* All newly restarted clients would have been unable to load configuration and receive load balancing assignments.\n**Cloud Load Balancing**\n* Approximately 50% of load balancers/target pools in europe-west8-b were unreachable.\n* Customers with Load Balancers configured in this zone would find them inconsistently available. If no Load Balancers were configured and available in another zone or region, requests to the customer's project would result in 500 errors.\n**Google Cloud DNS**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b would have been unable to write new DNS records for the duration of the outage.\n* Cloud DNS public name servers were unreachable from europe-west8-b during the outage, and intermittently unreachable from other zones in the region as a result of throttling as traffic moved from europe-west8-b to other zones in region\n**Memorystore for Redis**\n* Cloud Redis Standalone instances in europe-west8-b were unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n**Cloud BigQuery**\n* A small number of projects (one customer) may have experienced errors for API calls for a period of approximately 15 minutes for the tabledata.insertAll API. A very low error rate might have been present for jobs.insert and jobs.query operations as well, but these were mitigated much quicker through automatic recovery mechanisms.\n**Cloud Dataflow**\n* A small number of customer projects may have experienced stuck streaming jobs in europe-west8-b during the duration of the incident.\n**Cloud Build**\n* Builds would have terminated with status “INTERNAL_ERROR” for approximately 20% of builds in europe-west8 for the first approximately 20 minutes of the outage. Intra-region failover healed the user impact thereafter.\n**Cloud SQL**\n* A small number of instance create operations failed in the europe-west8 region.\n* Existing HA instances were moved to a healthy zone to restore connectivity.\n* Existing Zonal instances in europe-west8-b would have remained unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n**Cloud Armor**\n* Propagation of updates to Cloud Armor Security policies in Cloud Console stalled globally.\n**Cloud Filestore**\n* Up to 100% error rates for CreateBackup, CreateInstance, CreateSnapshot, and DeleteInstance operations for europe-west8-b zone.\n* Zonal instances in the affected zone were unavailable.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 7 February 2024, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial zonal service outage in the europe-west8-b zone for a duration of 1 hour, 8 minutes. To our customers whose services were impacted during this service outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe europe-west8 region recently received a networking upgrade to increase capacity and improve resilience. In order to minimize the risk, Google executes these as \"make-before-break,\" adding new capacity before decommissioning old capacity. The final step of this upgrade was to remove now-unused fiber connections between zones in the region. Deployment automation creates work orders for onsite technicians to remove unused fiber cabling from network devices and fiber patch panels.\nOn 7 February 2024, between 02:21 and 02:46 US/Pacific, onsite technicians performing this planned network maintenance inadvertently unplugged several fibers that were adjacent to those in the work order, but still in use for production traffic. As a result, a portion of the europe-west8-b zone unintentionally became isolated from a portion of the backbone network at 02:46 US/Pacific.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the partial outage via internal monitoring on 7 February 2024, 02:56 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers began reverting the fiber changes and restoring network capacity at 03:52 US/Pacific.\nSufficient capacity to serve customer traffic was restored by 03:54 US/Pacific, mitigating impact to the affected products. Full capacity was restored by 04:07 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence of this incident. The following actions have been identified:\n* Google engineers have paused all work of this kind globally, starting on 8 February 2024. This pause will remain in effect until the actions below have been implemented to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n* Complete the rollout of an enhanced physical work safety program, which includes updates to the current process for execution of planned work related to interfaces or devices serving customer traffic. The following action items within that program are relevant to this incident: * Creation of an automated notification system for the start / end of planned work related to interfaces or devices serving customer traffic. * Division of planned work into execution batches. * Require operational team supervision and monitoring for planned work. * Add multi-step verification of traffic status before fibers are disconnected. * Include additional controls as part of working procedures for the execution of critical tasks to ensure compliance with documented processes.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 7 February 2024, from 02:46 to 03:54 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial zonal service outage for europe-west8-b. Affected services included:\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\n* GKE clusters in europe-west8-b were unavailable.\n* Customers may also have experienced failures when attempting to create, delete, or modify VMs in the affected zone.\n**Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)**\n* Cloud KMS experienced a partial zonal outage for services in europe-west8-b, including Hardware Security Module (HSM), External Key Manager (EKM), Secret Manager, and Private CA.\n**Google Cloud Bigtable**\n* Customers experienced a service outage with non-high availability instances in europe-west8-b for the duration of the outage.\n**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**\n* VPC customers may have experienced increased packet loss in the affected zone.\n**Google Cloud Deploy**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b would have experienced errors creating rollouts and releases.\n**Google Compute Engine**\n* VMs in a subset of europe-west8-b were unreachable for the duration of the outage.\n* VM creations and deletions in europe-west8-c started failing as services failed over to that zone.\n**Persistent Disk (PD)**\n* PD devices in a subset of europe-west8-b would have been unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n* PD services related to snapshots, creation of new disks, and image creation for the affected zone would have experienced failures.\n* A small number of VMs with Persistent Disks in a different zone within the region saw guest errors.\n**Google Cloud Networking**\n* Cloud NAT, Cloud Interconnect, Cloud VPN, Cloud VR were unavailable for europe-west8-b.\n* Cloud Network programming was delayed for all customers in the europe-west8-b zone.\n**Service Directory**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b experienced read and write errors for the duration of the outage.\n**Traffic Director**\n* Stale configurations and load balancing assignments for all customers in europe-west8-b. This would have appeared as configuration updates not propagating and load balancing assignments not reacting to changes in load.\n* All newly restarted clients would have been unable to load configuration and receive load balancing assignments.\n**Cloud Load Balancing**\n* Approximately 50% of load balancers/target pools in europe-west8-b were unreachable.\n* Customers with Load Balancers configured in this zone would find them inconsistently available. If no Load Balancers were configured and available in another zone or region, requests to the customer's project would result in 500 errors.\n**Google Cloud DNS**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b would have been unable to write new DNS records for the duration of the outage.\n* Cloud DNS public name servers were unreachable from europe-west8-b during the outage, and intermittently unreachable from other zones in the region as a result of throttling as traffic moved from europe-west8-b to other zones in region\n**Memorystore for Redis**\n* Cloud Redis Standalone instances in europe-west8-b were unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n**Cloud BigQuery**\n* A small number of projects (one customer) may have experienced errors for API calls for a period of approximately 15 minutes for the tabledata.insertAll API. A very low error rate might have been present for jobs.insert and jobs.query operations as well, but these were mitigated much quicker through automatic recovery mechanisms.\n**Cloud Dataflow**\n* A small number of customer projects may have experienced stuck streaming jobs in europe-west8-b during the duration of the incident.\n**Cloud Build**\n* Builds would have terminated with status “INTERNAL_ERROR” for approximately 20% of builds in europe-west8 for the first approximately 20 minutes of the outage. Intra-region failover healed the user impact thereafter.\n**Cloud SQL**\n* A small number of instance create operations failed in the europe-west8 region.\n* Existing HA instances were moved to a healthy zone to restore connectivity.\n* Existing Zonal instances in europe-west8-b would have remained unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n**Cloud Armor**\n* Propagation of updates to Cloud Armor Security policies in Cloud Console stalled globally.\n**Cloud Filestore**\n* Up to 100% error rates for CreateBackup, CreateInstance, CreateSnapshot, and DeleteInstance operations for europe-west8-b zone.\n* Zonal instances in the affected zone were unavailable.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Tuesday, 23 January 2024 at 09:30 PT, Cloud Logging, and Google Cloud products and services that rely on Cloud Logging, experienced delays ingesting logs originating from us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1, europe-north1, and asia-east1. This resulted in customers not being able to view these logs in Google Cloud Console or other places that make use of the logging query APIs during the impact windows for each region:\n* us-central1:\t9:30-13:30 PT (4h)\n* us-east1:\t9:30-10:20 PT (50m)\n* europe-west1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\n* europe-north1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\n* asia-east1:\t9:30-10:10 PT (40m)\nExports of logs as well as writing to log-based metrics were also delayed in these regions during the impact windows. The issue also affected alerting through Cloud Console for Personalized Service Health (PSH).\nTo our Google Cloud customers who were affected, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe first time data is received for a log bucket that has Log Analytics enabled, Cloud Logging dynamically provisions resources necessary to ingest and store logs in BigQuery for that bucket. This requires updating state in a configuration database, which is accessed during log ingestion and routing. This configuration is required to ensure data is stored in compliance with each customer's organization settings.\nAs part of ongoing feature development, Cloud Logging Engineers increased traffic from a new set of projects to Log Analytics. These projects were ingesting logs in multiple regions and the ramp-up resulted in a large number of concurrent dynamic provisioning requests in the five regions listed above. This caused contention and slowdowns accessing the configuration database. While the Log Router has a load-shedding mechanism to protect against loss of throughput in such situations, there was a previously unknown latent issue that caused the problematic traffic to not be isolated quickly enough in a separate buffer. As a result, Log Router throughput was reduced by about 40% in the impacted regions, causing a log processing backlog to form.\nThe primary impact was that recently written logs were not visible to queries and log exports were delayed for log data originating from any of the impacted regions. This delay also affected Log Analytics, log-based metrics, and other Google products and services that rely on log data, including Personalized Service Health. No log entries were permanently lost, and all log entries were eventually successfully ingested, indexed for queries, and exported to configured destinations.\nTo quickly process the large backlog of data, the Log Analytics ingesters and log-based metrics pipeline were scaled up. This scale up led to two additional unintended secondary impacts.\n* **Log-based Metrics:** Queries for some log-based metrics with high cardinality were degraded for some users for about 25 hours following the event start time of 09:30 PT on 23 January 2024. Queries for such log-based metrics would timeout if the query time interval overlapped with the interval containing high cardinality values, as it is less efficient to store and query high cardinality data points. The internal cardinality of the metrics were increased because the writer tasks had scaled up to ingest the backlog and there was an increased number of late arriving logs. The issue was resolved when the high cardinality data aged out of the 25 hour in-memory retention window.\n* **Log Analytics:** Queries in Log Analytics would not return recently ingested data during the outage period until 24 January 2024 02:00 PT because the ingester scale up led to exceeding an internal connection quota limit.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via a support case and internal alerts on Tuesday, 23 January 2024 09:55 PT and immediately started an investigation. Once they determined that the feature ramp-up was the cause of the outage, they rolled back the feature ramp-up at 11:15 PT. This reduced contention but the recovery process was slow because the backlog already contained many logs that triggered provisioning. A change was then rolled out to accelerate the recovery of the impacted regions by disabling provisioning for the affected logs. The rollout completed by 13:40 PT, and the backlog was fully processed in all impacted regions by 14:15 PT.\nTo remediate the log-based metrics issue, Google engineers scaled down the number of writer tasks to reduce cardinality of the generated metrics. The degraded query performance was mitigated by 24 January 2024 22:00 PT as the high cardinality data aged out of the in-memory retention window.\nTo remediate the issue in Log Analytics, Google engineers raised the internal connection quota and changed the connection type used by the buffer processor from exclusive connections to shared multiplexed connections. These changes mitigated the issue for Log Analytics and the buffered logs were fully processed by 24 January 2024 02:00 PT. The mitigation will also reduce the likelihood of a future occurrence of connection quota issues in Log Analytics.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence of this incident. The following actions are in progress:\n* Change the rollout process used to implement these types of traffic ramp-ups, to reduce the blast radius of any issues that result.\n* Reduce the timeout for database operations in the Log Router, to ensure that problematic data is isolated more quickly.\n* Implement fault injection testing under load to verify that Log Router throughput can be maintained during both failures and slow operation of the configuration database.\n* Change the dynamic provisioning process to eliminate this dependency from the log routing critical path.\n* Improve monitoring, alerting, and playbooks so engineers are notified of and able to respond to log entry backlogs more quickly.\n* Improve the log-based metrics pipeline processing to reduce the cardinality issues that were caused by scaling up writers to consume the backlog.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Cloud Logging\n* Log ingestion in Cloud Logging was delayed for logs ingested from us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1, europe-north1, and asia-east1 regions. Ingestion of logs from other regions was not impacted. The following are the impact windows for each affected region on 23 January 2024: * us-central1:\t9:30-13:30 PT (4h)\t~50% of messages * us-east1:\t9:30-10:20 PT (50m)\t~40% of messages * europe-west1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\t~75% of messages * europe-north1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\t~1% of messages * asia-east1:\t9:30-10:10 PT (40m)\t~20% of messages\n* Queries of logs from the impacted regions would not return recently written data during the outage period.\n* Exports of logs from the impacted regions to BigQuery, GCS, and Cloud PubSub destinations were delayed.\n* Graphs and queries for log-based metrics may have appeared to have missing or incomplete data during the outage period. Alerts that depended on this data may have been missed.\n* Log-based metrics queries for some high cardinality metrics experienced degraded performance for some users for about 25 hours following the event due to in-memory retention of high cardinality data.\n* No logs were lost during the incident. However some log-based metrics, derived from the logs, may have gaps in the corresponding data points during the outage period.\n* Ingestion to Log Analytics was degraded for a duration of 12 hours.\n### Personalized Service Health\n* PSH Alerting through Cloud Console would have been unavailable during the impact windows for each affected region.\n* Additionally, messages written by PSH to Cloud Logging were also delayed for the affected regions.\n* The ability to view incident status on the PSH Dashboard and integrations to the PSH API were not impacted.",

Exports of logs as well as writing to [log-based metrics](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics) were also delayed during this period.\nIngestion delays in Cloud Logging had a downstream impact on Google Cloud products and services that rely on Cloud Logging.\nFrom our preliminary investigations, the root cause of the issue is a roll out of an internal feature for Cloud Trace that uses Cloud Logging. The rollout of the new feature caused an unexpected contention in accessing the configuration database used for Log Routing, which caused a backlog in the ingestion pipeline.\nThe issue was mitigated by rolling back the internal feature of Cloud Trace which concluded at 13:45 US/Pacific and the logs in the pending queue were gradually processed, mitigating the delayed logs issue by 14:15 US/Pacific. The issue with log-based metrics where the logs were not written to corresponding data points was mitigated at 18:05 US/Pacific.\nGoogle will complete a full Incident Report in the following days to provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n**Impact to Google Cloud products and services:**\n* Log ingestion in Cloud Logging was delayed for logs ingested from us-central1, europe-west1, and us-east1.

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Tuesday, 23 January 2024 at 09:30 PT, Cloud Logging, and Google Cloud products and services that rely on Cloud Logging, experienced delays ingesting logs originating from us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1, europe-north1, and asia-east1. This resulted in customers not being able to view these logs in Google Cloud Console or other places that make use of the logging query APIs during the impact windows for each region:\n* us-central1:\t9:30-13:30 PT (4h)\n* us-east1:\t9:30-10:20 PT (50m)\n* europe-west1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\n* europe-north1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\n* asia-east1:\t9:30-10:10 PT (40m)\nExports of logs as well as writing to log-based metrics were also delayed in these regions during the impact windows. The issue also affected alerting through Cloud Console for Personalized Service Health (PSH).\nTo our Google Cloud customers who were affected, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe first time data is received for a log bucket that has Log Analytics enabled, Cloud Logging dynamically provisions resources necessary to ingest and store logs in BigQuery for that bucket. This requires updating state in a configuration database, which is accessed during log ingestion and routing. This configuration is required to ensure data is stored in compliance with each customer's organization settings.\nAs part of ongoing feature development, Cloud Logging Engineers increased traffic from a new set of projects to Log Analytics. These projects were ingesting logs in multiple regions and the ramp-up resulted in a large number of concurrent dynamic provisioning requests in the five regions listed above. This caused contention and slowdowns accessing the configuration database. While the Log Router has a load-shedding mechanism to protect against loss of throughput in such situations, there was a previously unknown latent issue that caused the problematic traffic to not be isolated quickly enough in a separate buffer. As a result, Log Router throughput was reduced by about 40% in the impacted regions, causing a log processing backlog to form.\nThe primary impact was that recently written logs were not visible to queries and log exports were delayed for log data originating from any of the impacted regions. This delay also affected Log Analytics, log-based metrics, and other Google products and services that rely on log data, including Personalized Service Health. No log entries were permanently lost, and all log entries were eventually successfully ingested, indexed for queries, and exported to configured destinations.\nTo quickly process the large backlog of data, the Log Analytics ingesters and log-based metrics pipeline were scaled up. This scale up led to two additional unintended secondary impacts.\n* **Log-based Metrics:** Queries for some log-based metrics with high cardinality were degraded for some users for about 25 hours following the event start time of 09:30 PT on 23 January 2024. Queries for such log-based metrics would timeout if the query time interval overlapped with the interval containing high cardinality values, as it is less efficient to store and query high cardinality data points. The internal cardinality of the metrics were increased because the writer tasks had scaled up to ingest the backlog and there was an increased number of late arriving logs. The issue was resolved when the high cardinality data aged out of the 25 hour in-memory retention window.\n* **Log Analytics:** Queries in Log Analytics would not return recently ingested data during the outage period until 24 January 2024 02:00 PT because the ingester scale up led to exceeding an internal connection quota limit.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via a support case and internal alerts on Tuesday, 23 January 2024 09:55 PT and immediately started an investigation. Once they determined that the feature ramp-up was the cause of the outage, they rolled back the feature ramp-up at 11:15 PT. This reduced contention but the recovery process was slow because the backlog already contained many logs that triggered provisioning. A change was then rolled out to accelerate the recovery of the impacted regions by disabling provisioning for the affected logs. The rollout completed by 13:40 PT, and the backlog was fully processed in all impacted regions by 14:15 PT.\nTo remediate the log-based metrics issue, Google engineers scaled down the number of writer tasks to reduce cardinality of the generated metrics. The degraded query performance was mitigated by 24 January 2024 22:00 PT as the high cardinality data aged out of the in-memory retention window.\nTo remediate the issue in Log Analytics, Google engineers raised the internal connection quota and changed the connection type used by the buffer processor from exclusive connections to shared multiplexed connections. These changes mitigated the issue for Log Analytics and the buffered logs were fully processed by 24 January 2024 02:00 PT. The mitigation will also reduce the likelihood of a future occurrence of connection quota issues in Log Analytics.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence of this incident. The following actions are in progress:\n* Change the rollout process used to implement these types of traffic ramp-ups, to reduce the blast radius of any issues that result.\n* Reduce the timeout for database operations in the Log Router, to ensure that problematic data is isolated more quickly.\n* Implement fault injection testing under load to verify that Log Router throughput can be maintained during both failures and slow operation of the configuration database.\n* Change the dynamic provisioning process to eliminate this dependency from the log routing critical path.\n* Improve monitoring, alerting, and playbooks so engineers are notified of and able to respond to log entry backlogs more quickly.\n* Improve the log-based metrics pipeline processing to reduce the cardinality issues that were caused by scaling up writers to consume the backlog.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Cloud Logging\n* Log ingestion in Cloud Logging was delayed for logs ingested from us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1, europe-north1, and asia-east1 regions. Ingestion of logs from other regions was not impacted. The following are the impact windows for each affected region on 23 January 2024: * us-central1:\t9:30-13:30 PT (4h)\t~50% of messages * us-east1:\t9:30-10:20 PT (50m)\t~40% of messages * europe-west1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\t~75% of messages * europe-north1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\t~1% of messages * asia-east1:\t9:30-10:10 PT (40m)\t~20% of messages\n* Queries of logs from the impacted regions would not return recently written data during the outage period.\n* Exports of logs from the impacted regions to BigQuery, GCS, and Cloud PubSub destinations were delayed.\n* Graphs and queries for log-based metrics may have appeared to have missing or incomplete data during the outage period. Alerts that depended on this data may have been missed.\n* Log-based metrics queries for some high cardinality metrics experienced degraded performance for some users for about 25 hours following the event due to in-memory retention of high cardinality data.\n* No logs were lost during the incident. However some log-based metrics, derived from the logs, may have gaps in the corresponding data points during the outage period.\n* Ingestion to Log Analytics was degraded for a duration of 12 hours.\n### Personalized Service Health\n* PSH Alerting through Cloud Console would have been unavailable during the impact windows for each affected region.\n* Additionally, messages written by PSH to Cloud Logging were also delayed for the affected regions.\n* The ability to view incident status on the PSH Dashboard and integrations to the PSH API were not impacted.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 10 January 2024, Google Cloud Monitoring and all Google Cloud Products that expose Google Cloud Monitoring experienced dashboard delays and metric query failures (Initial degradation started on 09 January 2024 8:30 am PST, due to data staleness) for a duration of 1 day, 19 hours, 45 minutes and service metric data unavailability (which started on 3 January 2024 11:23 PST with a low impact window until 10 January 2024 09:30 PST) with significant impact window starting 10 January 2024 9:30 PST for a duration of 7 hours, 15 minutes. To our Google Cloud Monitoring and Google Cloud Products customers who were affected, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Cloud Monitoring experienced two distinct issues that impacted system metric data for most Google Cloud Products.\nMetric Data Queries:\nMetric data is stored in-memory prior to being stored on-disk. Initial degradation started on 09 January 2024 8:30 am PST, due to data staleness. A configuration change in data replication for us-central1 triggered a bottleneck in the pipeline responsible for moving data to disk for querying. Initially, this bottleneck induced backlog did not cause user-visible impact, given data continued to be served from the in-memory tier for the most recent 24h.\nWhen the pipeline blockage was mitigated 10 January 2024 8:00 am PST, the entire 20 hours backlog of files was rapidly ingested into the system that serves queries from disk. But, the resulting huge number of files triggered yet-another bottleneck in the on-disk system, causing high latency or failure for most queries.\nMetric Data Unavailability:\nA combination of two changes - one permissions-related and another scheduling-related - caused certain Cloud Metrics to be unavailable.\nThese changes were rolled out on 03 January 2024 11:23 PST. The impact from these changes was limited initially, but when mitigation was attempted on 09 January 2024 2:07 PST, it induced a bigger issue. The new problem surfaced due to a higher rate of server restarts.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nMetric Data Queries:\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the (not yet user-visible) data staleness issue by internal SLIs (Service Level Indicators) on 09 January 2024 16:58 PST and immediately started an investigation. Staleness began 09 January 2024 08:30:00 PST. When the high latency replica was removed at 10 January 2024 07:23 PST, the processing pipeline returned to normalcy.\nWhile response to this first issue was still ongoing, engineers were alerted by user-facing SLIs 10 January 2024 07:29 PST of user-visible query unavailability that had begun at 07:23 PST. They reconfigured the system to remove bottlenecks and increased the overall amount of compute resources available. This eventually reduced the backlog and returned to normalcy. All query availability/latency SLI also recovered fully at 12 January 2024 03:15 PST.\nMetric Data Unavailability:\nGoogle engineers were alerted by SLIs (Service Level Indicators) 09 January 2024 23:51 PST and immediately started an investigation.\nThe initial attempt at mitigating the problem caused wider issues. We stopped this mitigation and re-applied a newer patch that fixed the root-cause correctly. All remaining errors were resolved on 10 January 2024 16:40 PST.\nRemediation:\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Right-size the ingestion backlog processing that keeps up with load demand without affecting query availability.\n* Reassess and address the ingestion pipeline for bottlenecks that might induce this or related backlog issues.\n* Revisit the process for applying mitigations with better health indicators for side-effects.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Metric data unavailability:** * **Low impact window start:** 03 January, 2024 11:23 * **Low impact window end :** 10 January, 2024 09:30 * **Duration:** 6 days, 22 hours, 7 minutes. * **Significant impact window start:** 10 January, 2024 09:30 * **Significant impact window end:** 10 January, 2024 16:45 * **Duration:** 7 hours, 15 minutes\n**Metric data queries issue start:** 10 January, 2024 07:23\n**Metric data queries issue end:** 12 January, 2024 03:08\n**Duration:** 1 day, 19 hours, 45 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Monitoring and All Google Cloud Products that expose Google Cloud Monitoring.\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Monitoring experienced two distinct issues (metric data unavailability, metric data query failures) that impacted system metric data for most Google Cloud Products.\nBetween 03 January 2024, 11:23 and 10 January 2024, 16:45 US/Pacific a small number of Google Cloud Monitoring users experienced sporadic issues where metric data was unavailable creating gaps in the metric data. From preliminary analysis, the root cause was a rollout to increase the monitoring platform’s reliability, which inadvertently introduced an issue that is triggered upon monitoring server restart.\nBetween 03 January 11:23 and 10 January 09:30 US/Pacific, the rate of monitoring server restarts (and thus chances to trigger the issue) was very low. On 10 January starting 09:30 US/Pacific, restarts for a subsequent rollout triggered the issue more frequently. By 10 January 16:45 US/Pacific, engineers had mitigated the issue by rolling back the change that triggered the issue on monitoring server restarts.\nBetween 10 January 2024, 07:23 US/Pacific and 12 January 2024, 03:08 US/Pacific querying of metric data that is older than 24 hours in us-central1 experienced significant delays leading to query failures. This also led to issues loading some Cloud Console dashboards. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a failure in the pipeline responsible for data transmission from our memory component to storage component, hence creating a backlog. This issue was mitigated by resolving the failure and clearing the backlog.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n**Impact of Metric data unavailability:** * Customers impacted by this issue may have experienced delays and in some cases may not have seen the metric data in their monitoring dashboards. Some dashboards may have failed to load entirely. * GCP and third party products and services that consume these metrics via Cloud monitoring API would have experienced the stated issues. This includes products that rely on metrics for autoscaling. * The issue did not affect any custom metrics.\n**Impact on Metric data queries:** * Customers querying metric data that is older than 24 hours in us-central1 experienced significant delays leading to query failures.\n* This also led to issues loading some Cloud Console dashboards.\n--------------------------------------------------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 10 January 2024, Google Cloud Monitoring and all Google Cloud Products that expose Google Cloud Monitoring experienced dashboard delays and metric query failures (Initial degradation started on 09 January 2024 8:30 am PST, due to data staleness) for a duration of 1 day, 19 hours, 45 minutes and service metric data unavailability (which started on 3 January 2024 11:23 PST with a low impact window until 10 January 2024 09:30 PST) with significant impact window starting 10 January 2024 9:30 PST for a duration of 7 hours, 15 minutes. To our Google Cloud Monitoring and Google Cloud Products customers who were affected, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Cloud Monitoring experienced two distinct issues that impacted system metric data for most Google Cloud Products.\nMetric Data Queries:\nMetric data is stored in-memory prior to being stored on-disk. Initial degradation started on 09 January 2024 8:30 am PST, due to data staleness. A configuration change in data replication for us-central1 triggered a bottleneck in the pipeline responsible for moving data to disk for querying. Initially, this bottleneck induced backlog did not cause user-visible impact, given data continued to be served from the in-memory tier for the most recent 24h.\nWhen the pipeline blockage was mitigated 10 January 2024 8:00 am PST, the entire 20 hours backlog of files was rapidly ingested into the system that serves queries from disk. But, the resulting huge number of files triggered yet-another bottleneck in the on-disk system, causing high latency or failure for most queries.\nMetric Data Unavailability:\nA combination of two changes - one permissions-related and another scheduling-related - caused certain Cloud Metrics to be unavailable.\nThese changes were rolled out on 03 January 2024 11:23 PST. The impact from these changes was limited initially, but when mitigation was attempted on 09 January 2024 2:07 PST, it induced a bigger issue. The new problem surfaced due to a higher rate of server restarts.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nMetric Data Queries:\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the (not yet user-visible) data staleness issue by internal SLIs (Service Level Indicators) on 09 January 2024 16:58 PST and immediately started an investigation. Staleness began 09 January 2024 08:30:00 PST. When the high latency replica was removed at 10 January 2024 07:23 PST, the processing pipeline returned to normalcy.\nWhile response to this first issue was still ongoing, engineers were alerted by user-facing SLIs 10 January 2024 07:29 PST of user-visible query unavailability that had begun at 07:23 PST. They reconfigured the system to remove bottlenecks and increased the overall amount of compute resources available. This eventually reduced the backlog and returned to normalcy. All query availability/latency SLI also recovered fully at 12 January 2024 03:15 PST.\nMetric Data Unavailability:\nGoogle engineers were alerted by SLIs (Service Level Indicators) 09 January 2024 23:51 PST and immediately started an investigation.\nThe initial attempt at mitigating the problem caused wider issues. We stopped this mitigation and re-applied a newer patch that fixed the root-cause correctly. All remaining errors were resolved on 10 January 2024 16:40 PST.\nRemediation:\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Right-size the ingestion backlog processing that keeps up with load demand without affecting query availability.\n* Reassess and address the ingestion pipeline for bottlenecks that might induce this or related backlog issues.\n* Revisit the process for applying mitigations with better health indicators for side-effects.",
